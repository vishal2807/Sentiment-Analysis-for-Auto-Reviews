Thought I would try these no name wipers on my car and was pleasantly surprised.  The install and work perfectly.  Not sure how long they'll last but I usually change them every year anyway.  I order sets for my 3 other cars too.,0,1
"I priced this tool at many different places and Amazon was a very good deal, the quality of the product is good and I liked the fact it came in its own case with a big flag sticker made in America. I realized that does not affect how the tool works but it was a nice positive.",0,0
Fits an 2005 F-450 but the bolt is not long enough. Have to use a new bolt.  I will update this review after a few months of use.,0,1
Love that I can reach it from the front seat without looking and that it can be closed if needed. I line it with a plastic grocery bag so emptying is quick and easy.,0,1
"After lots of comparison shopping, I decided to try these. They are perfect for braided hose cutting. The hardest part will be NOT using them for other applications. Putting tap around your cut area, was a great tip, and makes a cleaner cut on stainless and other hoses.",0,1
If you have a small lift and bigger tires you will need this booster to make up the extra height. I had a friend unable to put the spare on when he got a flat. It fits on the storage compartment in the back. A must have.,0,1
"I love how pretty the bottle looks. Upon opening it and smelling, I didn’t think I’d like the scent at first. But I put it in my van and Ive got to say, the smell is quite pleasant.  It is not overwhelming (my daughter is more sensitive to scents). I purchased in January so I don’t know how warmer months will be, though I imagine the scent will be more pronounced. Until then, I’m happy with it and recommend.",0,1
Great whippers and good price.,0,1
"Great little lights! I plan to order more for another car. I did have a concern with condensation, so I used sensor safe RTV to seal up the ends (internally) of each light and after two suuuuuper heavy rain storms, they're totally dry. Great flood beam fills up the entire front end of the car and even the Tree tops! Exactly what I needed for living on a mountain.",0,1
"Seems awesome. Have not trial tested yet. It seems hard to believe this thin line can withstand 6,000 lbs. We will see.  Stand by.",0,1
"If I could give this zero stars, I would. I’d give it negative stars if that was available. It’s a great idea, just incredibly cheap and falls apart when you take it out of the box/wrapping it comes in. It’s supposed to make getting into those small corners of car windshields easier, but this does the exact opposite. I put the cloth on my windshield, moved down and POP. Off comes the attachment with ease. Virtually no pressure and barely moved. Again, I want to state that it was like this when I took it out of the packaging. The attachment doesn’t fit in the opening or it wasn’t properly installed. I couldn’t use this at all, plus it left some pretty awesome streaks. Do not buy this. Buyers beware!",0,1
"I consider myself a weakling when it comes to putting these types of things on that require a little muscle power ...lol... but I was able to do it!!! And it loves wonderful... no more cramping,sweaty hands loosing grip on the wheel on long trips ...(800+ miles )",0,1
"The title is correct, this is a solar maintainer, not a battery charger.  Should be used only on normal sized car batteries and science projects.  Put out about 15 to 25 VDC at about 100 ma, depending on how much sun it gets.  Great to power smaller solar projects.",0,1

I took a chance and bought a “used” can which it wasn’t used it was just damaged … heck I saved a bunch of money so thanks,0,1
This is a prefect replacement valve and  great value.,0,1
If you lobe the woodgrain look in your vehicle you will love this. Looks like it came from the factory like this. Came super quick. Unlike some others this one actually had 3M tape that worked so I didn’t have to take it off and use my own.,0,1
Running this on the handlebars of my Harley. This holds my phone great!,0,1

The photos the one on the left is an OEM one and the one on the right is the one I bought here on Amazon the one I'm reviewing. You can see a clear difference in size in the type it is. The float the one on the right is for different car clearly.<br />Well I just want to update this review. It was a five star because it worked for about a week. Perfect. No issues. Then I noticed like a little bit of hard time starting. Like 2 days after I left the review first time. It just slowly got worse and worse and worse until the point where it wouldn't start. So the only thing I could think of is the fuel pump. The car actually ran perfectly fine prior to me. I noticed a little bit of hesitation in acceleration and so I just thought I would do it seeing it's such an easy replacement. Like I said it after about a week and it was just perfect and no hesitation anymore or anything and all of a sudden it just started like dying on me. Not wanting to run. Or start like it wasn't getting gas. . So I ordered a different one seeing I already threw the older one out.  I bought it somewhere else though. So what I recommend this product? Hell no. And the other issue is when I pulled the OEM one out and put them next to each other. This one's like half the size of the body. I don't know if that has something to do with it but. Hopefully when I get to the other part it solves the problem and if it does I will definitely let you guys know.,0,1
"These shocks provided the ride improvement I was looking for. Was replacing high dollar 12 inch shocks. Wanted a 13 inch low dollar shock to see if ride was improved with a longer shock before spending on a high end shock. These shocks provide a controlled, plush ride, riding 2 up. I see no need to spend money on high end shocks. I'm very happy with my purchase.",0,1
"Similar to the galvanized version of the 1/2"" D ring, or ""shackle.""  Glossy finish looks good and appears durable.  However immediately a small section of black ""paint"" flaked of one of the circles through which the screw portion threads.  (I don't have the vocabulary to describe it very well!).  Under the flaked off paint the color of the metal is dark, so it doesn't stand out much.  Anyway, after contact with a tow hook, I presume that the finish will get scratched anyway.<br /><br />Aside from the paint, it is a solid piece.  For my purposes, it is more than strong enough, attaching to the end of a tow strap.  This D ring has thicker dimensions than the ring that screws into my bumper.  The 3/4"" would be overkill.",0,1
Cute little detailing set up everything works really nicely can't wait to clean my car,0,1
"Basically, you're paying for a $8 circuit breaker.",0,1
"This synchronizer DOES come with the alignment tool, although I successfully installed it without using the tool or setting the engine to top dead center. You just have to remerize where the magnet sits on the old one before you remove it, and make sure the new magnet lands in the exact spot. Tool 3 attempts, then it finally landed in the correct spline. Truck runs great.",0,1

"I got these to replace the carpeted ones that the wrangler came with. So much easier to clean, and they look almost reminiscent of a carbon fiber finish. They are thick enough that they wont curl up on the edges and they fit exactly into place!",0,1

This cushion works wonders for me while sitting in my recliner.  It's helped prevent lower back pain when I've spent an evening of watching tv or reading and/or sewing .  Has retained it's shape and firmness over time,0,1
Brought this for our tractor trailer we drive so my husband can use to work on tractor and not being on the bare ground and to keep his clothes clean while we on the road some states  we drive has a lot of snow and we broke down had to look under the tractor to fix a part it came in handy,0,1
These just snapped right onto the studs on the hood and fender mount. A matter of less than five minutes total including removing the old struts.,0,1
"We bought this based on the high users reviews and we were not disappointed. This is very light weight, durable mat this is very easy to clean and to fold back into its original shape to carry. We've only used it at the beach so I can't comment on how it holds up on other surfaces. Since this mat is very light weight, a slight wind will lift the corners up VERY easily. So I highly recommend anchoring it with something heavy on each side of the mat on a windy day. When we get home, I unfold it and hose it down with water. I let it dry overnight in the garage and by the next day, it's clean and ready to fold back up in order to take along for the next beach adventure.",0,1
Its old school analog technology but it seems very reliable and super EASY to use. You give up the accuracy of a digital meter but with this analog you can load test WITHOUT having to turn over the motor. You rarely can do that with a digital meter.  I would buy this again and I recommend it to others.,0,1

I've purchased a lot of hitches in my time and this is by far one of the best and most durable hitches I purchased. It's not super heavy but it's very heavy or compared to the other hitch I have that isn't as big or bulky looking or doesn't hold as much as this one. It comes nicely packaged and honestly looks like a nice little gift when you're receive it. It's very easy to install and it even comes with a locking mechanism so that way you're able to keep it locked in place so nobody can still your Hitch,0,1

A father that needed a taller jack for a Wrangler that has 33&#34; tires on it since the OEM jack couldn't handle the required height . I got him this and some gear that'd let him winch or pull or lift a tire /corner of Jeep up to change a tire if necessary and he was very happy with it all. I'm giving him a set of hilift 4rax to mount the 42&#34; version I chose for his smaller '94 Jeep. Probably in fear or up front ...,0,1
I was skeptical getting this since it wasn't  black and everything else on my bike is black but it looks really good!,0,1

"Definitely not crazy about this. VERY hard to work with, but easier to use than the paste. Leaves a streaky finish. Polishes well, but does not leave a uniform &#34;just waxed&#34; finish. Seems like it will hold up very well though. I used after using the Collinite cleaner, and still had issues with the streaking, which I believe is caused by both this wax and the cleaner. Oh well, at least it's protected!",0,1
Best brand tire great tire.,0,1
"My husband installed this after hearing what it would cost if he took the camper trailer to the dealer to replace. He installed it in just a few minutes (he is a mechanic, so maybe it was easier for him than it may be for others???). We used the airconditioner in the camper at least five times, and the heat once. It works the way it is supposed to.",0,1

"Exactly as described, ordered it for a neighbor and he put it on his car yesterday.  Some black Permatex RTV and a trip to the car wash to clean the engine and his leaks are gone.<br /><br />One thing about these, the gaskets around the spark plug holes are built-in to the cover, so it was necessary for him to replace the whole thing rather than replace the gaskets alone.  Cost a lot less than buying the cover from the dealership directly.",0,1
Easy to use,0,1
"I was excited about this product, but it is disappointing for several reasons. First, the handle isn’t very long. Second, it is pretty flimsy plastic and I feel like it will break soon when I try to lock it in place. Last, and most annoyingly, it leaves lint everywhere. I thought microfiber was supposed to trap lint, not spread it around. I think the concept is a good one, but this particular design could be improved.<br /><br />I do like the wash mitt though, so all is not lost. But I’d recommend just getting the mitt on its own.",0,1
"So well made. These are substantial in size and weight, which is nice for a keychain!  I bought these for our 7th Wedding Anniversary, so my husband and I each have one with our car keys!<br />I really like the leather that holds the charm to the keyring.  It's such a great deal and looks amazing.",0,1

"Black, of course, is the main color and for a good reason - it is the ""tough"" part that puts up with the dirty shoes 'n stuff that gets set on the floor boards of my car.  The sparkly bling is a dark blue - I would have loved it to be a brighter, lighter blue, but still, blue is my favorite color and these add a bit of girly bling to these mats and my car.",0,1
Works great.,1,1
"talk about bright great lite.<br />, you need to have room for them if you do its a great lite",0,1
I’m woman and was able to install this in about 30 minutes with minimal hassle. The hardest part was getting off the old heavy Tri fold cover. I did have to readjust the side bars when I realized the cross bars wouldn’t touch them when the cover is drawn. So I simply untightened the clamps and adjusted and then tightened. Overall very easy to install and value for the money is great!,0,1

"I received these door steps right on time.<br />They are sturdy and solid, and very well made (USA made)<br />I'll update later with a photo of these actually on my truck.<br />The most important information I must pass on to anyone interested in purchasing these door steps is that amazon states that these door steps would NOT fit my truck, when in fact, after visiting the Carr website, they most certainly will!<br />(FYI)  I own a 2019 RAM 1500 Classic Quad cab<br />Again, FYI, the Amazon site is offering these door steps for a lot less than Carr.com!<br />Just be sure to double check the Carr website just in case Amazon says these door steps will not fit your truck",0,1

Absolute game changer! I hate my 2018 SR5 Tundra’s center console setup and this thing made my truck complete! So convenient! I only used Velcro to secure it to the front plastic dash panel. I’m so happy. Hold all cup sizes. Literally exactly what I was looking for! Thank you.,0,1

"After a week of every day spending 10-20 minutes truing to buff out the streaks and haze I can finally see safely out of my windshield.  I followed the directions to the letter.  I tried to buff out the initial application to achieve the ""streak free"" look as promised, Instead, my windshield was so clouded with residue from the Cerami-X that I had to drive my wife's car for 2 days because mine was unsafe to drive.  The cloudiness and streaking was so bad that on multiple occasions driving at night I had to pull off the road on to the shoulder due to my windshield going nearly opaque from oncoming headlights. I contacted the help desk for Rain-X.  A week later I have still gotten absolutely ZERO response from them.  Stay away from this product.",0,1

"[[VIDEOID:52e5eb15372dc56b60193ae7fffab541]] These lights are legit! Super easy to install, brilliantly bright and no hyper flashing or error messages.<br /><br />I bought and installed 4 LED lights on my 2010 Camaro and the work very well. I read a bad review about corrosion, but that was installer error. (See pics in this review).<br /><br />I sealed the connectors with self sealing tape to keep moisture our of the connection point. Please, please, please. If you purchase these lights, go out and buy the self sealing tape I have shown in the images.

"Nelson Rigg is my go to for quality gear that does not cost an arm and a leg. I had the previous generation of these before and they lasted 5+ years of fairly serious adventuring.<br /><br />I installed these on my F800GS (with Happy Trail racks) and used them for a cross country adventure trip this spring. They stayed in place, kept my stuff dry, and did not mind the  tip overs.<br /><br />The all metal hardware is a nice touch, since I’ve broken quite a few plastic clips on other bags.<br /><br />The inner liners work really well and it’s extremely convenient for taking stuff in and out of your motel room. I actually like this system better than taking the entire bag off, since the bags are often covered in dirt, and dragging all that into a hotel room is a jerk move.<br /><br />The pads between the bag and the racks look a bit goofy, but work well.<br /><br />The only downside to these is that they don’t breathe or drain at all. So after a few days you’ll start getting some condensation inside the bags. Just need to remember to air them out once in a while.",0,1

Shockingly solid for the price. I don't know know why this set is so much cheaper but I'll take it! It put the ball joints in my kid's Lincoln Continental no prob.

"Great looking steps and work good too. I would have given them 5 stars, but the mounting hardware leaves a lot to be desired.

"UPDATED REVIEW: I really like the quality though recently we had a storm come through and blew it off my 2017 Artic Cat 700, leaving it completely exposed to the weather. I would suggest that if you are considering buying this item that you keep in mind that its use is limited to weather conditions and keep in mind that I had 3 other things that were completely secured and they were never compromised.<br /><br />It fits perfectly covers the entire unit. I needed the room in my 6 x12 covered trailer. It came with a bag that it could be stored in though I doubt that I will be using it because the cover will be in constant use. I wish that it had fasters to help it to stay in place. I appreciate that though I did not use our Amazon Prime account that it can before the expected arrival date. I hope that it will last for more than a season.",0,1
These are good quality and look great on my VW.  Will buy again if I lose any,0,1
"Seems like a nice unit but I have not been able to get it operational and have limited time to tinker with it.  Hope to get it out of the rig and onto a bench for testing.  Disappointing.  I expect once I figure out the issue it will work as expected but until then, I'm without heat in my camper.  I ordered this to replace the original, but sadly I did not have time to complete the installation for a few months, so any hopes of getting warranty support or replacement are down the drain I suppose.<br /><br />UPDATE: Finally 4 years later I had my camper in the shop for something else and told them about the heater not working. After removing the furnace (which they confirmed was installed correctly) they discovered the sail switch (keeps the flame from igniting unless the blower is going) had been installed but not plugged in when the unit was built.  This is an internal part of the furnace, so something I never would have touched.  After they plugged in the leads for the sail switch and re-installed the furnace it works properly.  To me, this indicates a lack of quality control at the factory... if this had been tested for 10 seconds the flaw would have been detected and the unit would not have shipped with this issue.",0,0

"I chose this clock because of the glow in the dark feature. However my car is in sunlight all day and this never glows at night. If I shine my phone flashlight on it, it will glow for a bit.

This one holds more than the one I already owned. But I bought it mainly to hold a bigger purse and to hold my water bottle. To my surprise it does not hold my water bottle when I am “admittedly” making a sharp turn! It does hold a larger purse. Assembly was tricky and perhaps I still didn’t get it right which may be why my water bottle falls out. Lastly because different family members sit in the front passenger seat…it is not forgiving when the seat position changes. But I think it was $5 so how much can I really expect/complain.,0,1

The engine has 8.5 mm Braided Core Spark Plug Wires, so they were somewhat larger in diameter than stock. They also have Silicone Jackets which make them more flexible but softer than stock. Because the molded edges are too sharp on these, combined with a lack of flexibility that would not allow wire engagement without a lot of pressure being applied, I ended up damaging the wires while installing the dividers. Consequently a new set of wires and dividers will be needed. Not good!",0,1

"These polished chrome plates are priced all over the place on Amazon. From $15.99 for one or two to $9.00 for one. This set had the chrome capped hardware included. Unfortunately some vendors did not have the capped hardware shown or non-existent and ruled themselves out of the competition immediately. At only $9.99 for two frames plus caps I was a little nervous about their quality compared to the plethora of others that were only a dollar or three more, sometimes for only one. The Amazon return policy is so solid, as a purchaser of hundreds of things over 13 years, if you don't like it, no problemo!<br />I live in Arizona. I only need a rear plate. However this pair was priced lower than majority of one plates, ok by only a buck or so.<br />Bottom line, this pair is quality, perfect chrome finish and hardware that fits. Why pay more???",0,1

"This item comes with threaded bolts coming out of the window motor bolt holes, and the seller does NOT provide the nuts to go onto the bolts. The vehicle itself has threaded bolts that secure the window motor to the door frame (threaded holes in the window motor housing). The replacement window motor portion is the exact opposite of this, so you will NOT be able to change out the mechanism unless you have (or purchase) the proper nuts. HOWEVER, the long metal slider *does* have the correct nut/bolt configuration. Why they provide this item with this configuration is beyond me. What should have been a less-than-half-hour job turned into much longer because I had to drive to Home Depot and get the correct nuts for this thing.",0,0
"Super easy to install and fixed everything.<br /><br />When my 2013 GMC Acadia threw an engine code, you could tell something was VERY wrong - the engine ran very rough, would stall at stop lights and stop signs, and the remote-start refused to even try cranking the engine.  Oh, and filling it with gasoline was an adventure in frustration.  Immediately after filling up, you'd have to give the car 5 to 10 minutes of ""rest"" before it would start.<br /><br />Fortunately, I have an OBD reader that said the recommend fix is to replace the Evap Canister Solenoid, whatever that is.  I called around to a few shops and was dismayed that this small part would cost in excess of $300 to replace.<br /><br />So, my wife and I got on Amazon and found this solenoid for under $30.  I looked up a YouTube video to see how hard it would be to replace and it looked really simple.  So, we ordered this solenoid and gave it a shot.  In less than 15 minutes my wife and I, rank amateurs, replaced the defective part.  Immediately, the litany of problems described above was fixed and the car was running as good as new. In a few days of light to moderate driving, the engine computer cleared all the engine codes.<br /><br />I couldn't believe the night and day difference between the defective part and this new one. It cannot be understated.  It was like having a brand-new engine!",0,1

I have it set to where the halo lights are on the normal/low beam light function and when you push the switch up to high beams it cycles through the main light functions.  Turn it to high beam once turns it to high beams, then down and back again does low beams and a third time turns it to the strobe function.",0,1

"I ordered the 'Vehiclex Off-Road Recovery Kit 3"" x 20' - 33000lbs - Off Road Snatch Strap, High Visibility Industrial Grade Webbing, Protective Sleeves - 2 Heavy Duty D-Ring Shackles with Isolators - Towing Kit Bag' for review.<br /><br />Our winter was quite mild and though I kept this Tow kit in my vehicle, there was never a need to use it. With that said, this is a nice Tow kit and there is no doubt that I I were to need it, it would be ready to handle just about any situation. The build quality is impeccable. Not only is the quality of the actual strap great, but the D-Ring Shackles to the case are also very good quality. The craftsmanship as a whole makes this kit well worth having for those ""just in case"" moments. The 20 foot length is not for every occasion but for most instances I feel that it will be more than enough to do what I would need it to do. I don't do much in the way of ""off road"" or ""4 wheeling"" but I do drive an all wheel drive SUV and would like to be able to help someone in need if I am able. This kit should work to at least help someone get unstuck if the situation were to arise. Overall I love this kit and think that though it is a bit on the pricey side, it is well worth the peace of mind it gives to have in my vehicle at all times. I hope that this was helpful.",0,1

It's mpg was 10mpg after reset and 3 full tanks ran through, do understand that's 32 gallons a tank if it was empty when filled. So I added a bottle and a half of this stuff, very skeptically I might add. My results? An immediate 13-14mpg average with at tank of gas. So I ran it out and took notes on each refill which would imply the Red Line SI-1 was out of the system. My mpg came down of course but did not return to the 10mpg, it stayed stayed at 12.7 which is very close to as new mpg on these. It seems to clean for sure.

I am unable to expend a lot of energy due to a lung problem, but I was able to clear my car off in less than 5 minutes!

A better design would be helpful!<br />UPDATE: this thing broke with the first heavy snow we had! The handle did not stay screwed down. I finally called the company and after sending my proof of purchase to them I was issued a new unit. They have a 2 yr warranty which is nice. I did not have to sent back the broken unit.

"If you’re familiar with Armor-All you’ll know what this product will do, but Meguire’s smells great. As with Armor-All, whatever you put this on will become darker (look's a little like it's wet) and shinier, so avoid putting it on top of your dash or the sun will create so much glare in the windshield that you’ll lose some visibility.<br /><br />Instructions suggest applying directly to the surface then spreading it around with a microfiber (less shiny results) or cotton towel. I tried that method, and an indirect application by spraying on the towel and applying from the towel. The best results came from direct application. The product is milky-white when sprayed on (sound familiar? It should) and the surface becomes silicone-slick after application.<br /><br />I do not like and have not used Armor-All for years because of the feeling and shininess it creates, but if you like a shiny, slick surface on the surfaces in your car, this detailer will certainly do the trick, and a little goes a long way. If you’re a long-time Armor-All user, try this out… it works just as well and smells so much better!",0,1

"I have been a faithful Techron gas additive user for some 40 years, finding that regular use every 5000 miles or so helps to keep fuel injectors clean and improves mileage. So when I purchased my diesel powered small RV, I did some searching and discovered that Chevron had just started making Techron for diesels. It’s so new that none of the local auto parts stores are stocking it.<br /><br />Just after my new diesel passed 5000 miles, I poured in a bottle of Techron Diesel at the next fill up. This isn’t scientific at all, but on my approximately 2200 mile trip, I had kept close tabs on my actual mileage, which averaged 18.3 to 19.1 mpg. The tankful with Techron was 20.1 mpg. I was westbound for the last 3 tankfuls, with a slight constant quartering headwind, over relatively flat country (Iowa, Nebraska, eastern Colorado).<br /><br />That’s good enough for me—I’ll keep using Techron Diesel in my diesel RV.",0,1

Rancho/Tenneco investigated and found the coil spring was roughly 10% too weak for the long wheel base 07 Expedition.  They paid for Ford OEM springs to be put on.  This brought the rear up to perfect height and stabilized the rear support and ride.  The adjustable shock has performed well on the road (at 7, with all Ford OEM front shocks and coils) and towing (at 9).  Tenneco technical/warranty support was EXTREMELY GOOD.  They paid all costs to figure out the problems and concluded the strut was not suited for my vehicle.  I recommended this strut be discontinued from sales.",0,1

"It has worked just fine for me. (So far.) I like to use it to keep my tire pressures in check, but it's very nice to have it in the trunk for those unexpected emergencies that we all know arise.<br /><br />It's not the fastest inflator in the world, but it seems to do its job. The cord is long *enough* and the hose screws onto the valve. The light isn't very bright so try to have another brighter light source at hand just in case it isn't enough. The auto shutoff function does work for me and it stops at my indicated pressure.<br /><br />It stows away nicely with the cord and hose wrapped up in the unit's compartment. It's cheap, simple, easy to use, and gets the job done. I can't stress enough how you need one of these. If you're ever caught it that situation, you'll be so glad you have one.",0,1

I totalled my car a few years ago and the passenger air bag exploded. I never replaced the air bag top as the person that repaired the car tried to glue it back in and only made it look worse -___-<br />I've dealt with it for a while but I've been wanting a dash cover but too scared to buy the wrong one.<br />I sent a message to the seller to ask if this was the right kind and they responded promptly and assured me it was so I ordered it.<br />When I got it in I just placed it on my dash to look and it fit perfect. I cleaned my dash off really well and aligned all the given velcro stickys and layed it down.<br />It looks so much better now and I'm not ashamed of my superglued effed up dash (:,0,1
"Got these to replace the &#34;bulb&#34; lights in my 26 year old hunting camp trailer.  They installed quickly and easily once I figured out that black (in trailer) was neutral (universal white) and black/white striped (in trailer) was hot (universal red).  They are somewhat narrower than the existing fixtures but it's a hunting trailer and I don't care.  Gives plenty of white,  &#34;daylight&#34; light and will reduce the heat from the incandescent fixtures.  Just wish it had a 3 point (off, on 1, or on both) switch.  Easy installation, plenty of light and cooler temps.  Very happy.",0,1

"Great price for an OEM style replacement rotor.<br />Installed a pair of these on my daughter's 1997 Jeep Wrangler SE.<br />Perfect fit, work great.<br />I pulled the old rotors and laid them on the bench next to the new rotors with the center hub or &#34;hat&#34; facing down and the large rotor surface facing up.  This way I could ensure they had the exact same height/depth dimensions.  I also laid them on top of each other to ensure they were same diameter (they matched perfectly).  I did this because I had read about possible differences in rotor mounting hub (center hat) size that can be deeper by about 1/8&#34; or 1/4&#34; on some models.  Anyway, better to confirm exact fit/size before going through the whole replacement procedure.<br />Also, to add a bit of personality and prevent a rusty appearance, I cleaned them well with brake cleaner, masked off the rotor braking surface, and painted the center mounting hub (hat) red to match the color of my daughter's Jeep - it's visible through the wheel and gives it a nice look.",0,1

First leather street gloves but I have quite a bit of they’re off-road stuff. Palm seems to have a couple spots that feel hard and randomly while I’m riding. Left index finger is about a fingernail longer than the right glove which is annoying. They have a decent feel to them. Hoping the palm spots go away once they’re broken in. Maybe got a rough batch. Riding stores have super long outdoor wait lines because of Corona otherwise I’d have gone in and tried them on to hopefully find some that aren’t longer on the one glove.,0,1

"I have a soft foot on the gas pedal.  My wife, on the other hand, is a leadfoot.  I purchased this to provide a constant reminder for her.<br /><br />It was easy enough to install in my 2010 Toyota Corolla.  Plug it in and away we go. Since my wife usually drives during the daytime, I set the brightness to the highest of four settings and placed the gauge on the dashboard directly in front of the driver's seat.<br /><br />The first problem was obvious immediately - one cannot read the meter in sunlight; the LEDs are not bright enough.  I relocated the meter under the dashboard in front of the instrument panel.  That location was OK when the sun didn't hit it, but when the sun did, which was about half the time, one could not read it.  Sadly, the ""constant reminder"" wasn't reminding anyone.<br /><br />The second problem appeared after about two weeks.  The ""Radial Fuel Efficiency Graph"" normally returns to one LED when stopping at a traffic light.  However, on occasion it would stop at a higher position, with most of the green LEDs lit.  Then as one accelerated, not much, if anything, would happen. This was true whether the A/C was off or on.<br /><br />On the good side, the unit is well built, easy to use, and all four displays seemed accurate.  my Corolla has a factory fuel economy reading, and the Ecometer's displayed mpg was extremely close to the factory mpg.  Same for the RPM.  If it didn't have a visibility problem I would have been a lot happier with it.",0,0

"First time vinyl wrapping. Probably took on a more difficult tasks than I should but with the help of my son, worked out perfect. I can't compare with any other brand but I advise having a helper and watch a ton of videos. Never used the tool they sell either. Used my hands and a heat gun. Trick is to not be afraid of working the material. Results are awesome but I can understand how and why people get frustrated. Be patient. The picture shows my daughter's speaker surround. It's curves and they had a flat ledge up top. Talk about a hard project for a beginner!  Whatever you do, but twice the material you assume. I had to start over because I didn't measure correctly. The material stretches nicely and will not rip as long as you have it properly heated. I still have to do the other side but can't wait to surprise my daughter. :)",0,1

"For some reason it didn't include the CURT 45592 Euro style ball mount as advertised.  But all I had to do was let Amazon know, and they refunded me enough so that I could buy it separately.  As for the hitch itself, it's nice, although the install took longer than expected, mainly because of having to fish the mounting bolts through the frame as I guess is typical on a car.  No drilling needed, but I did have to trim a heat shield which  was also a pain.  That, and my exhaust wouldn't drop more than a couple inches making it hard to use my hands and tools.  This is more an issue with my Buick Verano than the hitch itself, which is solid.  My car can only tow 1000 pounds so the 3500 pound capacity is well over-engineered. So overall I give it 4 stars.",0,0

"Used to replace the wiring harness on a 2008 Chevy Impala. The factory harness which attaches to the gear selector can wear out through normal use. This fixed our problem where the key would not turn all the way off, which would eventually drain the battery.

No need to solder anything, just cut off the old connector, strip the wire ends and use the provided couplers and crimp them together.

negative,"Received the multiple led bulb as pictured, it installed easily, only about half as bright as the incandescent bulb it replaced, used on drl’s on 2019 miata sport"
negative,I think this is my first negative review. Sorry.<br />The pump only worked for three pump jobs. (15gal). Moter works impellor spins no liquid comes out. Return window closed the day It quit on me and my bad back!<br />Choose another brand and run a search or two for the best non amazon review.
positive,The boys love it.
positive,"Hubby is happy with this, has it filled already.  Second Pit Posse cabinet purchased and very pleased."
negative,For what you get these are VASTLY over priced.  Are you really concerned with trying to keep your dirty oil clean before you recycle it?
positive,"Easy to put together, took on a road trip and it worked perfectly. Be conscious of where you place your roof rails because you may have to adjust them in order to secure the basket."
negative,"This &#34;barely&#34; holds my 26&#34; John Deere snow thrower.  I'm a little reluctant to go over bumps when transporting the thrower.  Otherwise, it seems very tough.  I would have no trouble with my push mover and gas can, etc.  The reason I bought it though...is for the thrower.  I'm not sure if I'll keep it.  Laziness may answer that question.  I'll post here if I have any problems."
positive,"The genius I purchased the truck from put both lock mechanism in backwards, the units replaced had function but the replacement was about prevention of future problems"
positive,"There's not much else to say about these fuse holders, they get the job done and they feel like they're good quality. I was only running 24v at 5 amps through the wire so I wasn't able to stress test the wire very much, but it worked well for my purposes."
positive,Cheap ignition system that worked for my pit bike.
positive,"I don't know why some buyer complaining about fitment, it fits great."
positive,Good value
positive,Excellent quality and ACDelco is a premium product line.  These pads have a lifetime warranty as well!  Great instructions for lubrications points printed inside of the box which is great for weekend mechanics.
negative,Torn quickly not great on windy nights
positive,Looks great and holding up well
negative,"My guess is that the only item needed to make my 38 year old Jack function well again was the main piston seal.  I got this kit and used the new high pressure seal and wiper, which were not leaking.  The low pressure piston seal, which was shot.  The low pressure o ring and wiper, which were fine.  I used all the original ball bearings, which were fine and I new they were right for the Jack.<br />They also furnish some cooper washers for the valve assembly that are just way to thick.<br />For what you get and can use kit is ridiculously priced.  Unless you have some bad leaks my guess is you “sagging” Jack can be fixed with a $17 main piston seal."
positive,Worked fine and was well packaged. This is the second time I've ordered and I had no problems.
positive,"Took just a few minutes to install, fit like a glove and much brighter than the stock lights! 1998 Chevy blazer"
negative,Only good on hard plastic.
negative,We ordered the small (the smallest they have) for my 6 year old daughter which is supposed to be a size 4 and for kids 2-5 years of age.  It is huge.  My guess is that the coat will fit her when she 8 or 9 years of age.  It comes down past her knees.  Unfortunately there is not a smaller size.  I understand making them big to fit clothes underneath but it is ridiculous and making them extremely long doesn't help fit clothes.<br />The pants aren't quite as bad.  Still too big but somewhat usable
positive,"I needed a Windshield channel for my Jeep TJ to support my new Soft top.<br />This product appears to be made from heavy, strong thermoplastic that fits nicely onto my Jeep.<br /><br />It fit right into place and worked with the support bars which came with my soft top.<br />So far, so good!"
positive,I have had these for 2 years and they are a life saver...
positive,Does the job of blocking the sun.
positive,Great product. I have a Jaguar V12 with &#34;purposely designed&#34; spark plugs that are nearly impossible to access. This tool made changing plugs a relative breeze. The magnet is very strong and works like a charm for both insertion in the head as well as removal from the head. Highly recommend it.
positive,Worked and works great.
positive,works well with a 5.7 chevy engine
positive,"May be fine for hitch balls, but I needed to adjust my Weight Distribution Hitch itself and this just wasn't long enough to get the required leverage.  Had to purchase a breaker bar and socket anyway."
positive,Easy to install! Appear to be H. D. enough for the job.
positive,GREAT PRODUCT
negative,"You live and you learn . . .<br /><br />I purchased this product because I would need it but I didn't need it immediately so it sat in the tool drawer until I did.  That was my mistake.  When I finally did go to use it, it leaked all over.  First I tightened all the fittings and then I taped all the treads and tightened everything up.  The unit still leaked so I contacted the manufacturer asking about a new hose.  It's been almost two weeks and no answer.  Obviously they have better things to do than to help customers with defective products.<br /><br />The lesson is clear: test the product when you get it because you can then return it.  Now I've got to see if I can find some fittings that will allow me to fashion my own hose so I won't lose my entire investment.<br /><br />I will never darken this company's doorstep again.<br /><br />UPDATE: A couple of weeks ago, I got an e-mail from the company and they sent me two replacement hoses.  Better late than never.  Unfortunately neither of them will hold on to the tire valve (they are the push-on clip type).  When I try to inflate, they just blow off.  Even when I hold them in place they seem to leak.  In 20 minutes of trying with these hoses, I didn't manage to add one pound of air to the tire.<br /><br />UPDATE as of 18-Mar-2016: I tried spraying silicone into the chuck to see if the seal was just too hard to make a proper seal.  Epic fail.  This product is never going to work.  Sadly, they have gone into the trash can because that's the most appropriate place for them."
negative,Didn't take long to rust
positive,"Great hitch but there is a big gap of adjustment when the hitch is at it's minimum setting, you can't go 1 inch drop because the lock is in the way, otherwise good"
positive,One hook was missing but it still works!  I like this product.
positive,Simple enough socket that fits well for my oil filter
positive,Awesome item
positive,A little wider than the one in my Ranger. Love it. And easy to install.
positive,"This tray is the perfect place to put sunglasses, coins, tissues, etc.  It makes a deep space where things weren't easy to find or reach and makes it very useable."
negative,cheap garbage. avoid.
positive,A+
positive,Perfect fit
positive,"Durable and functional and great for my mudroom. My floors stay clean and all because of SafetyCare Heavy Duty Flexible Rubber Boot Tray, Multi-Purpose for Shoes, Pets, Garden - Mudroom, Entryway, Garage and Floor Protection tray!"
positive,"Is a litle bigger for a 3 series bmw, well built"
positive,This was a great add-on to my 2010 Harley Davidson Electra Ultra Classic.
positive,OEM part. Fit my 2016 RAM truck.
positive,"Always impressed by the quality of the products I buy from Rhino. For a small family business they do first rate presentation and packaging. The D ring shackles are a deep high gloss black. Hope I never have to test the break strength of 41,000 lb."
positive,its grey but looks white in the ad picture
positive,Great fit and a nice strut.  Nice tight ride so far.
negative,"First I would like to say that I totally support concentrated bottles as they can save the environment from plastic waist. I was looking forward to trying this item out because of the small quantity the bottle mentions to add for a gallon of water.  What I found out is that the directions which stated to use 2 capfuls per gallon just doesn't create much suds at all as I’ve shown in picture 1.  After adding 2 additional capfuls of soap for a total of 4 capfuls per gallon, the suds results were better and the solution seemed to have a bit more of a soapy feel to it.  Later that day, I also washed some plastic parts with the 4-capful solution and they came out clean.<br /><br />Overall, I honestly feel you would need to use about 8 capfuls to a gallon to wash a car and have a good amount of suds.  One last thing I will mention is I tested this on a Dewalt 4400 psi pressure washer which has a pretty strong soap supply line. I had set the washer at about 2200 psi because setting at 4400 would probably take some of the body paint off.<br /><br />With all this said my final thoughts on this soap are that it’s okay but the directional recommendation is not accurate."
positive,"Fits a Challenger, same as one that was replaced. Great price too."
positive,Great Product!
positive,Looks beautiful.  But it is water soluable so it does wash off
negative,These are not the Dorman's that I bought originally.  The diameter is not as thick as before.  I don't know who makes these.
positive,Very good book.  Lots of details and photos.
positive,"The pressurized coolant tank is the number one failure point of the (flawed) design by Chrysler (borrowed from Mercedes Benz, yet the MB system works because they don't use thin/cheap plastic).  If you have a Dodge or Chrysler product with this design for coolant system, you will be buying one of these every 3-5 years.  The local dealer wanted $150, and this Dorman replacement is better than OEM specs, fit perfectly, and has eliminated my coolant leak... BTW, I bought this from Amazon because it was $20 cheaper than my local auto-parts house!"
positive,I should have ordered 2
negative,"Not copper nickel, sticks to a magnet. It's copper plated steel.  Trust the 1star reviews, avoid this product."
positive,"Had the issue with multiple warning lights (TPS, VSC, Antilock Brakes, Traction Control) on my RX330.  This replacement stop light switch did the trick - only thing I'd caveat is that the replacement switch seems 0.5cm longer than the OEM part but was able to squeeze it into the space and reconnect the electrical wires to it without an issue."
positive,"Works good for a good price, and it is a white light like OEM part not blue like some of the others."
negative,Neither decal would stick. Adhesive glue on back was either old and dried out or just no good. Ended up wading em up and trashing em. Not my first rodeo installing decals. They were junk.
positive,This charger is just brilliant and so easy to use!!!
positive,"These work great, I've used them in rental cars, personal vehicle, and friends/relatives vehicles without any issues. The hanger makes it convenient to just hook over the post for the rearview mirror, and I don't have to worry about it falling on the floor 5 minutes after I shut the car door...lol"
positive,works
positive,Made my 1988 motorhome look ten years younger. I recently sold the motorhome for what I originally paid for it.
positive,"It works well, good product"
positive,"Nice and bright, JDM lights have been very reliable for me, I have a half dozen or more installed in my truck."
positive,[[VIDEOID:1f132e8eb1a75d183fd1f1345a9c9d50]] This is a great product and works amazing for the price
negative,"Yes.  They are pretty.  They simply look great when mounted.  I replaced RainX wipers that were less than six months old and, frankly, ugly.  The RainX  did not conform to the curve of my windshield and therefore did only a fair job of wiping.  These Densos cost less than half the RainX and are far better.  So far, these are perfect: no chattering and full sweep cleaning....and really good looking.<br /><br />I AM MODIFYING THIS REVIEW.  AFTER ONLY EIGHT MONTHS, THESE THINGS HAVE STARTED CHATTERING IN SPITE OF THE FACT MY TRUCK IS GARAGED.  ON TO A DIFFERENT BRAND..."
positive,great
positive,"I purchased these to replace 12-volt light bulbs in a fixture over the dining table in my RV.  I do not have any kind of light meter to specifically test for brightness, just observation.  The bulbs are close to natural white in color temp, and I think they produce the brightness of the 12-V's I replaced.  The big (and desirable) difference is the LED's are cool to touch and draw less power from a 12V system.  The bulbs arrived earlier than anticipated from the seller and in good condition."
positive,Fixed a transmission leak on my 07 charger that was not O ring related but cracked plastic housing.
negative,"These are pretty inexpensively made to attach the GenTuri to a camper sidewall in lieu of drilling holes. In my case, I have to attach them to a window. One held, the other didn't. Upon examination, I discovered that that one had been cross-threaded, so it worked much better after I fixed it. I then installed the GenTuri, attaching it to the suction cup mounts, and ran the generator under load for about 15 or so minutes. They held. But I'm not willing to say that they will hold every time. So far, so good."
positive,"I bought the Forge reservoir for my wife's 2005 MCS R53 from OutMotoring dot com last year.  I decided to &#34;risk it&#34; and purchased this one for my 2005 MCS R52 even though it wasn't branded as a Forge product.  I'm glad I &#34;risked it&#34; because it is the EXACT same reservoir that all the well known MINI sites sell for twice the price.<br /><br />I am a Nondestructive Technician and trained on inspecting weld for quality and I'm here to let everyone know that this reservoirs welds are IDENTICAL to the original reservoir I purchased elsewhere.  With that being said, I would hope that you are now confident enough to purchase this for a fraction of the cost of the more expensive units out there.  I am in no way affiliated with anyone who manufactures or sells this product.  I just want to save fellow MINI lovers some money.<br /><br />One last thing.  The description is WRONG.  It should read:<br /><br />02-06 MINI Cooper S R53 and 05-08 MINI Cooper S Convertible R52....because I own one of each."
positive,"This faucet works good,also looks good no problems easy to install ,easy to clean it had no problems. at all was packaged very good"
positive,"If you can change your oil, you can install this kit.  Very simple to install, they should have included a few more zip tie's."
positive,AWESOME<br />Easy to install<br />Look great<br />They don’t bend even when a very large person gets in my truck
negative,Does not fit 2002 Honda Civic. Useless!!!
positive,Love the tires.  3 tires came one day and the 4th came a few days later.
positive,We use this for a speaker at the drive in
positive,"This is exactly what you would expect, it says exactly what you want, and is easy to tuck away."
positive,Haven't used them yet. Looks good. Switch throws nice. I don't know about weather proof. Will look cool on my chopper scooter I'm building.
positive,"After using this tool my guess is that for some applications the handle would be just about requisite. Using a breaker bar worked OK, but I think a proper, tight-fitting handle (as designed) would have made it quite a bit easier."
positive,Very good deal
positive,Very easy to install on a Lexus IS250
positive,Good product which was used for a lexus RC fog lights.  The lights look great with this simple mod and pleny of left over vinyl for other cars!
positive,"I was in no hurry to over pay at dealer to replace my cabin filter. I looked up a video on Utube, saw how easy it was to replace it. Got same filter and FINALLY made 20 minute job and 20 minute job! Filter was exact same and easy to swap out. Priced well vs. others as well!"
positive,Purchased this along with the clear end attachment and works as expected!
negative,Larger poly piece wont fit. Must be wrong part in package. Kit should also include upper bushing kit to make it a complete kit.<br />&#34;Magical shifter tightening&#34; didn't happen here!  Not worth screwing around with a return. Waste of my time!  Lesson learned!<br />Seller's shipping was fine.
positive,Serves the purpose with a more pleasant smell
positive,"Very heavy duty, I carry it in my truck all the time"
positive,This part was a great replacement. The top screw was not in place with the old one. We found out why. When you move the shifter. It hits the screw. It is still secure without this screw. We watched the video on replacing. Simple and easy.
positive,Installed on a 1989 Cadillac Sedan DeVille with the 4.5L V8 engine. Perfect fit and seal! Solved the boiling issues in my return tank and I am no longer having cooling issues with the vehicle. Great product and great fit! Highly recommended!
negative,"I needed a 'sturdy' tray, this one isn't it. I think there are at least 2 changes required.  1) There needs to be a more rigid board (maybe a thin plastic insert) to allow the tray to be rigid. This one has way to much give.  2) the upper-strap (not the head-rest velcro strap) apparently was designed to be a cost savings buy making that strap to be the support for the tray. It just isn't great because my driver seat is curved (not flat) so the strap doesn't hold tight at all and slips.  I would love to provide input to make this more practical for the customer-user.  For now I'll still look for a better option or find a way to modify this one to suit my needs & my toddler's needs."
positive,Snug fit and looks great
positive,Great fit
positive,Looks cool on my fob.
positive,"[[VIDEOID:2a68d678f5b07862703f33b4c2994504]] No matter what you drive this can keep you going.  This is built like a brick and delivers amazing power.  The speed charging has this unit up and going in 5 minutes.  The LED is interface is visible in directly sunlight and at night.  It can jump a car multiple times.  The average car jump takes less than 10% of its power.  The USB power jack, 12 volt jack are nice upgrades.  The LED light are good, just wish they where on both sides.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)"
positive,"Bought as a replacement, works good haven’t had any issues,"
positive,"Pretty good for reducing scratched/fogged plastic covers on headlights. Doesn’t look like new, but major improvement."
positive,"Fit the Coleman mini bike we bought it for it’s the camo one from tractor supply. Fit right, no issues."
positive,"I bought this spray to arrest the terrible problem I have with mold on tack in Tidewater Virginia.  It's damp all year, and I've had to clean my tack every..single...ride.  or I return to green fuzz on every surface.  If the tack sits a week, it has green fuzz even if I do clean it before putting it away.  Belvoir Tack Cleaner Spray has stopped the  problem.  I use it once a week to manage the mold.  HOWEVER, this stuff is terribly drying and contributes to &#34;brown out&#34; on black saddles and bridles.  I still have to condition most of the time, but at least this spray seems to inhibit the mold growth.  I don't have to clean every time now; Once in awhile, I can get away with just a wipedown, and that's nice at 8 p.m.!"
positive,Works on the lug nuts of my 2014 mercedes GLK 350.
positive,This stuff really works great and smells awesome. I highly recommend.
positive,"Worked as advertised. To make sure, I looked up the main company website (FCS auto parts) and cross referenced the struts for my make of vehicle to be sure both of the search results matched. They arrived very quick and changing both sides out took about 1 1/2 hours. Both of these complete strut sets cost less than a single full strut at local auto parts stores."
negative,It stopped working and started smoking after one use. Cannot recommend. Likely unsafe.
positive,I have used this from dress shoes to boots.  I went into Allens Boots in Austin and this was what the salesperson suggested I used on my boots.  I have used it ever since.
positive,good fit
negative,The spark plug worked ok but the prime shipment was only 3 days late. Chat was useless.
positive,NO problems......I really like the design with both jumper clamps and permanent battery connection.  Quite versatile.  And affordable too... ..
positive,Works as advertised
positive,"Compact design in an organized case, hands-free screw-on valve stem fitting.  If you're just topping off your tire pressure, the cylinders won't even get hot.  Would be improved with larger battery clamps."
positive,Fit my wife's Rav4 Driver side blade perfectly! I always love RainX products! They work so well!
negative,Thought this would be a good idea! Def a big no!<br />Very cheaply made<br />Cleaned the areas for the adhesive parts and as soon as they have any pressure whatsoever they pop off and won't stick anymore...
positive,2007 Trailblazer was running too cool. Replaced the thermostat with this ACDelco and temperature has been perfect since. Came with an o-ring. Not a fun job on this vehicle.
positive,Works great . It will cut your water pressure by about 50% . To be used as a secondary rinse . No water spots . I also fill jugs for pur iron /steamer and it seems to help
positive,"Doesn't get as warm as a real electric blanket. That said, it's ok and my chihuahuas like it up here in Wisconsin!"
positive,2009 Sonata - driver door. I received in 3 days and at half the price of local suppliers that had to order it. 15 minutes if you work with cars a lot. 1 hour if you have limited tool experience. Some torx head tools (? #10) needed. See youtube.
positive,I liked the easy install. Nice fit and better than other expensive products. No cons.
negative,"Super light.  Cheaply made.  I waited to long to try them and missed the opportunity to return them.  Threw them out. They are light plastic, so they stick to the bottom of your cup when you take your drink out of your drink holder. Twice it rolled under my excellerator pedal.<br />Unfortunately I ordered a set fire my daughter who also threw them out.  Cheap, cheap, cheap."
positive,Installs in 5 minutes. Good value.<br />The straps could be improved to be more sturdy<br />Overall nice design 👌
positive,Very easy install. Once installed very bright and well light up. Amazing price. It easily attaches to many different gmc and Chevy vehicles. If you have issues contact support and they can help you trouble shoot it. We'll worth the buy because these are brighter then the original
positive,Great item and service.
positive,Exactly what I needed. Super fast shipping. A lot cheaper than buying from the dealer or fast change oil center!! Will buy again.
positive,Perfect for my car. And less costly than the auto parts store.
positive,"The best thing I can say about this cleaner is that it is low-suds and appears to leave a minimal residue. Many cleaners, when used on fabrics, tend to be soapy and leave a residue that attracts dirt. As to it's cleaning ability, it is very gentle, which translates to needing some elbow grease to make it effective as a cleaner.<br />Would I buy it again? Well, I've been buying it for 3 years, see no reason to stop now."
positive,Man did I score she loves this in her 05 new beetle convertible
positive,wonderful for the front of my 1967 classic Buick Electra 225 !!
positive,[[VIDEOID:84ede72d91bce420587e6f44a21893a9]] Clean that glass<br /><br />I like the design of this. I thin it make sense for cleaning glass and keeping it shiny<br /><br />It’s easy to use and like the idea of keeping my<br />Glass Looking great
positive,Worked great.
positive,awesome
positive,"I was looking through my order list one day and my husband came in and saw this and kept asking about it saying he HAD to have this.  I was so excited- he WANTED to test something out for me.  That was great.  Then he balked at putting it in the car for a while.  Let's see what happened when he FINALLY put it on.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a kit which is installed as interference between your car's electronic draw, and the battery.  If you accidentally leave on something or if you have an electronic malfunction, the battery connection will be disconnected to save what charge is in the battery.  This has two connectors, one for positive and one for negative.  You only use one or the other.<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />The instructions are pretty well laid out.  One side is for the positive, the other is for negative.  There are photos to help you in your installation.<br /><br />HOW LONG DID IT TAKE?<br />It took my husband about 15 minutes to install this, but he tends to really look at things and take his time.<br /><br />DOES IT WORK?<br />So far, he has had this in a vehicle that he tends to leave lights on and have power problems.  So far it has worked well.  Recently, he was told that he could not drive that car anymore due to dangerous frame issues (Saturn Vue).  So, it helped so far, but the trick is going to be to get him to disconnect it from THAT car before he gets rid of it and reconnect it to his new car which is an electronic playground.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is easy to install, seems to work well, and is something we will be keeping in my husband's next car as he has a tendency to forget lights, etc, and drain the battery at times.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I like this, it does what it says, and if it means I will hear a lot less of the moaning when he leaves his lights on, or has power issues with his car, I am ALL FOR IT!<br /><br />UPDATES<br />I will update this review if my husband manages to install this in his new car before discarding it with his old one if there is anything more to add to this review.  I hope it works in this car as well as his last one!"
negative,La calidad es definitivamente mala. No se ajusta a los vehículos que promete deben ajustar
positive,"These look awesome on my 07 Stratoliner. Big bike needs big bars, and these fit perfect and look great."
positive,"Exact replacement, works great"
positive,Perfect
negative,"Product does not fit a 2006 Nissan Titan at all.<br />The product is way, way, way too small as a replacement bulb for my Titan.  The bulb just falls out of the socket as soon as you flip the third light over.  Information on the company's website is wrong."
positive,Used the BAL 28012 X-Chock on my 35 foot 8000 lbs travel trailer and am very happy with them. Very easy to install. Because of the fender flares on my Travel trailer I flipped them upside down when installing them to make it easier to tighten and loosen with the supplied wrench
positive,Easy to use and made a very nice flare.  Got the job done much sooner and cheaper than calling someone to do it for me.
positive,First year horned frog.
positive,"I find that bulbs have a somewhat shortened life span in the driving lights on my motorcycle due to being mounted on the front forks where vibration is high. Most auto parts stores carry H3 bulbs, but only in 50W, not 35W. I did find one local shop that had a few - at $23 each! Online, I found these at less than a tenth of that, allowing me to lay in a stock of extras for less than the inflated price of one bulb at the auto store."
negative,"Ordered a 433 MHz tire pressure sensor and got a 315 MHz or something sensor that didn't work with my car and the window for returns is gone. So I got the wrong one can't return it and still have the same problem. Audi, here I come. Thanks for sending me the wrong item, Dorman."
positive,Simple gas cap that works prefectly
positive,These are great for keeping clutter off the floor of my car with any purses or lunch boxes.
positive,"Great quality part. I replaced the original 40 year old mercury coupler on a Mercruiser 120 (Chevy 153 4 cyl) set up. Be aware that it is physically larger in diameter and has a larger bell. Doesn't affect installation or functionality. I got a killer deal on this through an amazon warehouse deal for only $50. In my experience, I've also tried the no-name brand ones on eBay and amazon in the $90-$100 range for another boat. I've found those to be good quality as well, and am convinced they come from the same Taiwanese manufacturer.<br /><br />You might consider getting new grade 8 7/16 fine thread nuts with a locking nylon insert - you would need a 6 of them. that being said, I reused the originals with red locktite, with no problems, years later."
positive,Solid metal not chrome plated plastic. I keep one in each car and my garage. Readings are very consistent.
negative,"2015 wrx uses drl as high beam as well so I didn't want to get a LED which will work as high beam all the time, so I try this out its ok I wanted the 5000k color for drl mode, but only getting 5000k when I do high beam. It's still better than stock drl color so I'm keeping it, but if you want 5000k for drl than you just need to get LED."
positive,made my car look like new! easy to install.
positive,works
positive,great product with fast shipping
positive,great quality
positive,Looks a fits great.  Happy customer!
positive,Perfect fit for our Snapper zero turn mower
positive,Thank you.
positive,"I don't know why I didn't get one of these sooner, it sure makes the job a lot easier."
positive,I used this soap on my car and on the outside of the windows on my house. It foams up well and smells great. It washed dirt off and left no residue. Recommended!
negative,Broke as soon as we put it on. Back to where we started. Starting to rethink ordering through Amazon...
positive,"Easy concept to install but a little tricky for big hands trying to find a spot under the car seat to hook the clips onto. Feels very dense-thick & plush feel; no bald spots.  A little expensive however, worth it.<br />Need one for the split rear bench :))<br />Highly recommend"
positive,Looks beautifil in my 2016 Charger.  The black and red is perfect with what I have going on.  Not gonna lie though it took some strength to get this thing on but it fit like a glove after I put some muscle into it.
positive,Item fit like a glove ideal for what I need to do keep some organization going.
positive,Taught my daughter some easy car maintenance. Fits 2011 Hyundai Elantra great.
positive,Bought this 4 months ago. I thought everything work great but one of the bulbs failed again this morning.<br /><br />Updated: seller contacted me and offered free replacement. Excellent service.
negative,"Product came without the black ring, so the nozzle just sets in, it doesn’t secure. Would be happy to change review if I can get the ring, otherwise it’s useless if I can’t keep the gas in the container."
positive,"Great replacement battery for my Zumo 550. Great value, grest quality."
positive,So far so good with these no complaints 👌🏾
positive,Worked well and didn’t ruin the car’s paint
positive,"The struts fit, 1st attempt.<br /><br />These struts operate the rear window better, than ever. Much better than when this 2008 SUV was brand new."
negative,It can only hold water bottles or slim cans
positive,"Super easy set up, the clip snaps into the back easily and it just clips onto your vent. Blowing air helps circulate the scent. Of course it smells strongest when you first set it up, but a hot day will increase the scent as well. I appreciate the two pieces come attached in separate containers so they don't lose their scent while the other is in your car. It smells nice and citrusy and fresh. I think you could push it to 30 days, but I like a stronger smell so I put the other one in sooner."
positive,Great
positive,Cheap protection for your RV.
positive,Removed hose clamps and replaced the original inline breather with the new one.  New breather is the same size and length.
negative,We had two Borg-Warner replacement thermostats on our 2000 Z3 2.8L. Both failed.<br /><br />The first one (installed by the previous owner) got stuck open after a couple of years. The second one leaked around the integrated temperature sensor after just six months (see picture).<br /><br />For the third replacement I went with a cheap Chinese knock off. Can't be any worse than these...
positive,works great fit as it should n is as stated.
positive,they work well
positive,"Great price, nice fit, leather isn't stiff and feels broken in already. Very comfy!!!"
positive,Durable and easy to use.
positive,"I have a 107 inch long Hyosung GV650 (which had a really big body itself) with a middle size trunk. This cover fits perfectly. The material is quite thin but strong. I use it for 3-4 month now in winter time in Southern California (which means no too cold, no snow, etc) and no too strong sunlight either, and the cover already started to fade out. But this is almost normal, other covers also lasted for about 6-8 months only."
negative,Didn't work for us...so I'm not saying it won't work for other people...it's worth taking the risk for the very low cost.
positive,Worked perfect for my 05 Toyota Tacoma I bought it to fix my stiff shifter but only time will tell how long it will last hopefully as long or longer then OEM
positive,"So far so good, only thing that was kind of irritating was the brackets that clamp the sides to the bed were a bit loose. Greatfully, I had the brackets from my old ladder rack that i was able to use to work it out. Why spend 300 dollars or more on a bed cover when you can buy this one for 150? Extremely satisfied"
positive,"These fit perfectly on my 09 scion xd.  Didn't even have to take any wheels off, used an offset screwdriver."
positive,Car wash friendly
positive,"bought this 3 years ago, still on my front door today :,)"
positive,These are exactly what I was wanting for my jeep.  They were a great price and I am so excited to install them!
negative,Product it not that great. Flimsy at best and just take too long to do the job on my truck front windshield. Would not buy again
positive,As advertised
negative,"Just received mine today, sure enough it's a Chinese knockoff of a Chinese product, oh well. On the bright side, it's a pretty good replica but not exact and it is two sided."
negative,"This will not shield the hole, of an Acura Integra brake bracket where the brake calipers pins inserts to, from water and dust, since it's diameter is too low. Stretching it may cause the bushing to tear. Also it's longer than the OEM ones, causing the caliper pin to not go in as far as it should. I'll be returning these."
positive,It kindda looks military
negative,Easy to put but can be bothering when or if driving.
positive,This thing worked great! I sort of see how people could have a tough time getting the ratchet to engage but if you can't figure this simple tool out you really shouldn't be working on your car.... Easy and effective!
positive,"this product was received quickly and was a genuine OEM Mann filter.  Works great,  will definitively buy again for my vehicles."
positive,I like the feel of the cover and it felt solid in my fingers and has held up really well.
positive,Real bright very Satisfied better than the cheap ones
positive,"My husband loves this, it looks nice on his truck. He has received compliments from other Cowboys fans"
positive,Didn't fit my vehicle as expected
negative,"Not a decal but a sticker, dont waste your money. I purchased from Sticky dudes thiland forrest"
positive,"This easy to install car holder can hold purses, diapers, wipes and more to keep your car more organized. It's made thick and sturdy and holds your accessories without buckling under the weight of them. My purse is usually just thrown down in the seat and would wind up in the floor. Same thing with the couple baby diapers I take with me. This has helped me to keep everything clean dry and right where I can easily reach it. Great value"
positive,This is a great pajama set. Looks very nice and is Soft and comfortable. Fits true to size and seems well made.
positive,"These are great. In our attached garage the slab has settled over time and when snow melts off it runs to and puddles in a low spot near the door to the house, not ideal. These are a lot cheaper than mud jacking the slab back to perfect and can easily be squeegeed out the garage door. 2 compact size mats fit our daily driver priuses with plenty of extra length and width. In my detached garage I have a Truck/SUV size to keep the floor dry so I can fold it out of the way when I want to pull out tools and use it as a workshop. The truck size just fits lengthwise for my ram 1500 with quad cab and 6' bed. If your truck has a crew cab or a long bed I'd get the XL size so you don't need to worry about parking as perfectly."
negative,Nothing did not work
positive,"Fits perfectly, easy to install.  Defog works!"
positive,"Fits a normal box of tissues over my center console, in a Toyota Corolla. Not perfect, but does exactly what I wanted. Will NOT hold a box behind a headrest or over a sun visor."
positive,The dealer wanted $200 plus tax for these side moldings. I think even at $178 on amazon they are way overpriced for what they are ( painted plastic trim with double sided tape) Mine came with templates for easy 5 minute  installation. They aren't really that noticeable on the car which is a good thing. Hopefully they will help to prevent door dings. The middle of the CRV door feels quite flimsy as it bowed quite easily when pressing these gently into place.
negative,Not good
positive,Installed on our 2004 Winnebago...resistor was easy to replace...hardest part was sealing it back in.  Works terrific!
positive,Easy one bolt install
positive,This product helps keep away from the curb to prevent tire rash
positive,"I bought this because I HulkSmashed the original buttons in a fit of rage when the BCM issue in my 2007 Saturn Aura made my cruise control stop working. Not my most mature, responsible moment, but luckily enough I was able to easily replace the buttons myself after Googling how to disable an airbag and then buying a cheap ($12) Torx set for the one Torx screw holding the button cover in place. After that, it was super easy to swap out, and now I have functioning cruise control again!"
positive,Great item for reaching the top of your car.versatile
positive,Good product.  Easy to work with
positive,Beautiful adornment for the car.
negative,"Sadly I would give this a 5 star review, except for 2 things which make me give it a star. The first is not a big deal, it has a reinforcement strap that goes in the top that is impossible to get in all the way.<br /><br />The real reason however I am giving this one star is the attaching mechanism. The buckle is as cheap as it gets. I tried to install it and tightened it. Apparently it was at a bad spot and when I closed it, the buckle just snapped. So I spent $20 on something that I now have to figure out some way to attach it because the buckle is useless.<br /><br />Other than that the quality of it seems good."
positive,"Exactly as described, AcDelco item. Be sure to lubricate the o ring on the sensor. No relearn or anything is required after installing this part. It only goes in one way."
positive,"When my Jeep Grand Cherokee Hood wouldn't stay up and threatened to cut my head off guillotine style I knew it was time to replace the gas shock. Getting one from a Jeep dealer was not in the cards, their prices are just too high although I admit I did not check out the price of this item there. Amazon had it it was shipped in 2 days easy to install and it now keeps my hood up and I can keep my head!"
positive,good brake bleeder
negative,"I ordered the black with white stripes pattern. Upon opening this package every seat cover was stained. This is annoying because I bought these to hide my stained car seats. It looks like the black dye rubbed off onto the white. So if you are going to buy these I would avoid this pattern.This also looks nothing like leather. It looks, feels and smells like the vinyl installed in cars in the 1970s. Within 5 minutes of opening the package my husband asked me to have these off gas outside because it smelled up our living room. I was desperate to see if I could get these to work. They do not fit my 2007 Subaru Legacy Wagon well. Twenty minutes after installing I called up a local car upholstery shop and made an appointment to have a kit installed that will fit much better."
negative,"the mounting tab actually broke on me whenever I tried to give it any type of torque.<br /><br />Took it apart and noticed that the cap looks like it was just a 3-d printed junk piece of plastic, and the metal the distributor was made from was a very low quality. I'd save your money and just go with a spectra or standard ignition if you could find it at the parts store. Buy once cry once."
positive,👍🏻
positive,"No hassle replacement for 2006 BMW M Roadster. Fits like a glove. Unfortunately, BMW cupholders are often broken with normal use and $150 or more at the dealer to replace one is easily beaten by this component and then looking at youtube videos with screwdriver in hand."
positive,This Moog K8695T006 ball joint fit perfect and seemed easy to install.  They are required to be replaced where I live if a car fails inspection so I took care of the work myself and saved quite a bit of dollars in labor charges even though the part is not that expensive.
positive,"The size is good for my Ford Edge.<br />It has good storage.  The front and ends are sturdy but back and bottom are thin, may wear out much quicker.  The 2 tie down straps are a good idea but theres no where in my car to attach them.  I feel like $35-40 is about what this is worth."
positive,Seems very sturdy and the handle has a good shape to grab on to.
positive,Recommend this over just the TPS. Just buy the harness as well. My personal mechanic put it on and liked the fact that I bought oem as well as the harness because he didn't have to because they are brittal and always brake somewhere.
positive,Easy installation. Good fit all around.
positive,"Please note this can only work with your car's cigarette lighter unless you buy an adapter; the adapter is NOT included. I briefly and too quickly read some of the reviews before I bought and thought the adapter was included. Other than that, the small tool works great with the cigarette lighter. It's so easy to attach and works quickly. It is loud but no louder than any other compressors I've heard. I like that it stops by itself and can be programmed to whatever psi you want."
positive,"I have a couple of low end OBD II readers as a DIY mechanic, just throw one in every car of mine. Among those readers, although they have similar functions, basic code reading, live data, freeze frame data, etc, I like this one best, mainly because the much faster connection and rugged build"
positive,Awesome product!!<br />I bought it for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! Great looking and sturdy kids travel desk.<br />It's very easy to use and keeps all her stuff organized.<br />Life saver for long drives or traveling on an airplane.<br />Very recommended!!!
positive,"Works great,I used the first on a sander,too fast,it blew apart,my fault,I put the second one on a polisher,works great"
positive,Filled my car tire and dolly tire in Korea time. No more driving around to fix air pressure in cold temps.
positive,Helps your vehicle look finished
positive,"[[VIDEOID:ed7917e0a54b36b786300bd314cc1156]] I bought this for my mother in law who lives in a rather remote area.  It's difficult for her to buy frozen groceries because they are thawed out by the time she gets home.  Even thermal bags aren't good enough.  This is a real game changer.  It isn't just a cooling refrigerator type box.  It's an actual freezer.  To test it, we cranked it all of the way up and ice started to form on it.  It definitely works for what she intended,  but we have also taken it camping, too.  It's so much fun to be able to have fresh, cold ice cream on a hot afternoon after hiking."
positive,This is just what I thought it would be and fits great on my trailer I hope I never have to use it but I'm sure it will be okay if I need to use it as a spare
positive,Good quality and price !
positive,"Installed this yesterday on my 48 volt club car precedent. Install went smooth, used the factory wiring, only needed to add a small jumper wire, then make a ""Y"" off of the hot wire coming out of the ignition switch. One note, the included spade connectors are junk. I threw them in the trash and used some quality ones i had in the tool box.<br /><br />Seems to function well, got the cart down to ""1/2 tank"" after a few hours of riding around the neighborhood. Gives a bit of reassurance that you're not running too low on juice.  I will try to fact check this thing by measuring voltage and comparing to what the trojan site says for capacity."
positive,Good quality<br />Heavy duty. Fits good on both ends.
positive,Perfect for and works great!
positive,"I only buy non-ethanol gas for all of my outdoor gas-powered toys (tractor, chipper, chain saw).  I add this to every 5-gallon container of gas I fill.  Even after a winter, everything works great!"
positive,Thanks
positive,Installed it works great
positive,They worked fine for my dashboard.
negative,Poor quality and also it is not calibrated which means wrong reading.
positive,WIN! Ford wants $19.95 for their filter. This girl ain't having it. Fits my '13 explorer sport 3.5L ecoboost (twin turbo).
positive,This should be fine from my trip from Florida to Michigan for the holiday
positive,Good for polishing light materials.
positive,"This was bought as a replacement bottle for the bottle when dropped that split around neck from our pressure washing kit.  It is equal to the bottle that came with the kit, in same thickness, size, shape and threading of top as previous.  This bottle was much more reasonably priced than buying the original kits replacement bottle.  I would recommend this bottle for in your pressure washing Soap kit."
positive,Works just fine.
positive,as described
negative,"I wanted a better one and I was willing to pay for it, but I could not find anything else. I looked for hours. It is hollow instead of solid as another reviewer said. My trailer hitch is solid, so that doesn't sound like an unreasonable expectation. The D-Ring clamp is terrible quality. It was too small and I had to force it on, and the threads were poor quality and I was worried that I would need tools to get the pin out on a cold night when I needed it to work smoothly. I replaced mine with a Smitty from Amazon.<br /><br />Warning: At the time of this review Amazon recommends buying a [[ASIN:B001CF1A6U Smittybilt 13047B 3/4"" Black D-Ring]] but it does not fit. I know because I followed Amazon's advice and purchased two of them. Amazon refunded an expired VISA rebate card, so I lost the money ($25+) and Amazon refused to help. I should have kept them.<br /><br />The Amazon recommendation should say buy this 1/2"" version [[ASIN:B004K2BH4W Smittybilt 13046B Black Powder Coated D-Ring with 1/2"" Pin]]. I replaced the stock D-Ring with this one and it fits properly and is better quality."
positive,Excellent.  Really does the job.
positive,"This is absolute perfection! It fits my 2020 Sahara unlimited (jlu) like a glove. It's engineered precisely to fit all the edges and to be removed with ease. The only think I could wish for is that it could've been ""taller"" on the sides to further protect the enterior of the jeep"
positive,Great build quality.
positive,Top of the line selection of various sized flat aluminum washers.  Worked perfectly on my Honda CR-V and Pilot rear end differentials.
positive,Works perfectly to organize the glove box.
positive,I took this to jiffy’s Lube Today  and omg it really help me Understand that is is the best oil for my car since I have Hyundia accent 2016
negative,Guess I did not read 5/16
positive,"Interim review.  Additional time is needed to judge lasting ability.<br /><br />I have used Rain-X for years, so I believe in this type of windshield treatment.  This product takes longer to apply than Rain-X.  There is a cleaner provided, and a recommended cleaning process. After this is done, the rain repellent is applied.  I cleaned my windshield and rear window with this product. I then used Rain-X on my side windows.  Rain-X is easier to apply, and I usually get 1-2 months out of the Rain-X before I reapply.  I didn't use the gloves, and didn't get any product on my hands.  Very small towels are provided.  The small size actually prevents waste.  Eight drops into the small towel, multiplied by 4 for the full windshield uses 32 drops for the windshield.  If you use a larger towel, you can waste a lot of the treatment.  Probably took me about 20 minutes for the total job, vs a few minutes for the Rain-X.  Rain-X is cheap, so you spray whatever you want on the towel, and wipe. A haze appears in a full minutes, wipe it, and you are done.  These bottles are very small so you don't want to waste any.<br /><br />When finished, my windshield was the clearest it has ever been.  The cleaner, and recommended cleaning process really does help.  I thought about using it for my headlights but decided against it.  I'm not sure if the heat from the headlights  could cause a clouding over effect if this product is applied to the headlights."
positive,Love this scanner.  for the price it does everything I wanted
negative,"The frame is well made and has a nice finish. The problem is after I installed it on my 2012 GMC Sierra 3500 truck, you cannot see DENALI as it is blocked by the lower section of the bumper.  Also, the frame partially blocks the license plate County and the month/year tag sticker at the bottom of the plate. Due to these issues, I removed the frame."
negative,"The 2 1/2"" to 4"" inch Shock is the same as the 4"" to 6"" inch Shock. Same numbers stamped on the shock."
positive,thanks
positive,"If you read much you will see these tires are one of the highest rated tire in general, not to mention in this price range.  I can't speak for the long term usage as I just got them.  First thing I noticed is the stock tires on my machine (25x12's) are just under 24 inches tall aired up.  These tires are true to size, and are sitting in my garage not yet mounted and they are already an inch taller than stock.  Once mounted and aired up I will gain a couple inches alone."
positive,Works good
positive,keeps batteries at full charge. Works great. Would buy again.
positive,n/c
positive,Work as intended. One broke a little bit is still functional.
positive,Already used have the package in the garage.  Great for wiping grout and immediate paint stains.
positive,These work great on our truck! Will definitely be purchasing again when it's time to replace.
positive,"Okay, I made the mistake of being cheap, not once... but twice before this order.<br />I have also confirmed with others who made the same mistakes, pretty much everything under the 30 dollar mark is for a bicycle not a motorcycle. And even so, the ones above the 30 dollar mark that are made for motorcycles are not made for people who ride hard. What I mean by this is if your ride off road, or even just street and come down a little hard from a wheelie you will still probably knock the phone loose on most other mounts.<br /><br />This one actually hold the phone stable under all speeds and conditions I have had so far.<br /><br />I had to mount it a bit uncconventually on my ducati as this is a track bike with very little room to clamp anything, and the clip-ons are already short mounted with no room to connect to the bar itself. So I finagled and used the mounting bracket smaller U bolt around the protruding spring setting screws from the front fork's suspension.  Its a little interesting of a connection, but Its holding rock solid and I love how it fits.<br /><br />This was definitely worth the cost, as it may be a bit more then I wanted to spend on a mount, its better to spend 50 up front then 1000 for a replacement phone when your cheap buy drops it on the highway at a buck 30.<br /><br />I will try to post back in sometime and update if it changes, if I don't update its holding fine."
positive,Good quality
positive,"I used this belt on m '99 Toyota Tacoma and it worked perfectly.  Much quieter than the OEM belts that lasted 15 years and 100K miles.  No complaints on the original belts, but these definitely seem to run smoother."
positive,"This carb took a while to get, but works just like the original one, GOOD product"
positive,"This i is great!  You know, new gas cans have become a real pain to use.  Between environmental concerns (such as spillage) and child safety features, they've gotten hard to pour without spilling (ironically).  Add in that the cans are heavy and this really is a great idea.  I got this for my father and it really helps him out and prevents all the lifting.  Love it!"
positive,Great for the money
negative,These lights have a metal lip separating the fuse from the light. Unfortunately this makes it just a few cm short of fitting in the reverse light slot. Great bright bulb but to short to fit
positive,OK
positive,"These seat covers are nice.  However, I wouldn't say they are very durable, but they do seem to be pretty durable.  They look good on the truck and fit pretty well (2015 ford f150)"
negative,"Cut out housing  , and fold filter to fit into space. Not enough  room  between  floor  and  housing  were it installs"
positive,These covers fit well and are made of heavy fabric. They are air bag compatible and look great. The price is very reasonable. Great product!
positive,Easy to assemble and great for detailing.No more back strains for a change.
positive,"There is nothing like the real thing. These full sized seat belt covers do an excellent job of cushioning. I liked them so much that I bought an additional set for my sister who recently had open heart surgery and needed the additional cushioning. She trashed her small faux cushions in favor of the super plush full sized sheepskin covers. Now, every time she gets into her car and puts on her seatbelt she is reminded of the caring of her big brother."
positive,Perfect fit for my 2012 Wrangler with Pentastar V6 and an easy swap.  This solved a drivability problem I have had with the Jeep for a while where it would cut out at low RPMs.
positive,I love Adam’s products high quality. Pricey but worth it.
positive,works fine
positive,OK for the money. A bit smaller than I thought.
positive,"I am an older guy who continues to take care of about 2.75 acres of landscaping in Southwest Florida.  The heat and humidity causes the grass to grow all year here, so quickly that you have to mow twice a week in the summer.  Unfortunately one of my boundaries runs next to an old state highway, resulting in constant trash somehow ending up on my property.  Some of the trash probably falls off garbage trucks and recycling trailers, some of it is the result of littering, but the end result is several sharp metal objects hiding in the grass. Regardless of how well I police this area additional objects turn up weekly.<br /><br />I usually get around to mowing this area on weekends when the local landscaping equipment and garden stores are closed. Several times now I have rolled over something hiding in the grass and punctured tires on one of my two lawnmowers and/or my Heavy Hauler (Rubbermaid).  Since I can't get new tires or tubes at the repair shop, I try to keep extras in my storage shed for just this situation.  Of course sometimes I forget to restock what I need and that's why I keep a few cans of Fix-A-Flat handy.  The directions are simple to follow and I would bet that 90% of the time this aerosol tire inflator allows me to finish the job.<br /><br />I also keep a can of this in the trunk of each of our vehicles.  Those have also come in handy for me (and other family members) and a few stranded strangers.  This product is extremely easy to use and does a great job."
positive,[[VIDEOID:c077efa3033ef7794131e51cefbd3116]] Hotep my friends and family. What I like about this cover it's a little larger than the car that I'm covering. We have a bad wind problem out here dear. I like that it is weatherproof because we have some weather out here that's a goof. I recommend my friend; you need to add a little extra protection to your vehicles now and then. Thank you for looking at my review. I hope it is beneficial for you. God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  Baba Oran Z
positive,Easy to install and does not require a plugin. Light works great with scratch-free mirror.
positive,"Good metal clips, none broke during install on the socket rails.  Hold sockets firmly.  Used on both Neiko and craftsman rails."
positive,"Although my sister ended up not being able to use this, it was because of her car and not because of anything to do with the product.  I had purchased a large number of items directly from the company for myself and as gifts.  I liked everything I purchased.  A few of the ""gifts"" ended up staying with me and going in my car.<br />Everything is very well made.  The fabrication is sturdy.  The designs make sense.  I have a couple box like items with lids that velcro in the back of my car to hold both dog items and the miscellaneous things you need when traveling, like maps, plastic utensils, bandages, ink pens, etc.  I was so surprised when I took them out and found they too had been made by this company!  I particularly like the ones that can hang over the seat as that makes it so easy to access without using your floor space.<br />The company has great customer service.  I had to replace one trash can as it was missing a small part and they quickly sent another.<br />Highly recommend any and all of their products.  PLUS MADE IN USA!"
positive,"NOT all sensors are created equally.  I originally purchased a Standard Motor Products [reputable company] Cam pos. sensor and had two in a row that are not even close to the 2007 YARIS spec's.  I have access to the Toyota tech guide and it spells out what the Ohm's range cold and hot should be. If its NOT in that range it's no good.  Both of these popped the MIL light.  With a good FLUKE meter I proved this.  I ordered this one and its perfectly in the middle of the acceptable manufacturers Ohm's range.  I advise everyone to find the spec's and bench test before installing to save time. Luckily I still had the OEM sensor that I was 'refreshing'...at 14yrs & 140,000 miles I wanted to do a complete sensor 'tune-up' to prevent any problems for my teenage daughter when she's away in college."
positive,"This was an excellent value and does the job as a Level II charger flawlessly.  We hired an electrician to do the install, and he finished in under an hour.  This may vary depending on your situation, but we had an available spot for the 60 amp breaker in our main electrical box.  I wouldn't worry about the short cord unless you are installing it in a location that has an outlet already installed and it does not allow the unit to be placed next to it.  In that case, buy a different charger.  Otherwise, for a new install, this should meet all expectations."
positive,"Easy to install, great price, not too heavy but still is sturdy"
positive,Bring on the bad guys.  Easy to install and a piece of mind for my rear seats.
positive,"Whanted this for night driving Since they are lot brighter, but had to take them back out because it is illegal in my area to have them. You might wanna check 1st if it's allowed in your area"
positive,Vacuum hose is one of those things you don't think about until you need it in a hurry. I'm guilty of running to the local auto parts store and buying a few feet at a time. The problem is I use a small section and then lose the rest. Having this spool of it ensures that it won't be misplaced next time.
positive,works great
positive,"Outstanding stuff. First, use Rewind to remove any existing wax or non-permanent coating, then be sure to clay your car and maybe polish. Now you can throw on the Recharge. Goes on super-easy, just like a detail spray. Apply two more coats at five-day intervals and you're set. Your paint shines like a mirror and feels super-slick to the touch. Seems to work well on metal, chrome, glass, and vinyl. Haven't used it on the interior yet but I just might. Only downside is the price."
positive,Perfect addition to my toolbox
positive,After replacing it I used a different car to take my old one to Pep Boys and after testing it they told me it was good!
positive,"Comes with a USB with a sketchy pirated GM Tech2Win emulator and GDS2 software that antivirus goes crazy over virus detection...  This is not any official device and the GDS2 software does not work with it.  You have to do all kinds of playing with the drivers and such to get it to work and not for the novice user.  Highly technical experience needed to setup these pirated programs (USE A VIRTUAL MACHINE, DO NOT USE YOUR LAPTOP!!!)..  I was able to use as a MDI2 emulator with my ACDELCO TDS SPS2 subscription to update all the computers and infotainment in my C7 to the latest dealer versions so I didn't have to go to the dealer to pay for updates.  $45 for two year subscription for 1 VIN is a killer deal when it costs minimum $200 to see a dealer, let alone even do an update.  I was scared the entire time I was updating the computer modules in my car, but it worked.  Plenty of guides online show how to use this VXDIAG NANO with ACDELCO TDS/SPS2 software.  But user beware at their own risk, no telling what else this little thing is doing in the background."
positive,"Installed quickly and easily on my sister-in-law's PT Cruiser. One screw to remove tail light. Unplug the old one and the bulb, plug in the new one and the bulb. Replace tail light."
positive,"This cover is a direct bolt-on over my 2001 Dometic refrigerator vent on the roof of my motorhome. The cover is made of pretty thick gauge plastic, much stronger than the original and is bright white. The one downside is the Camco paper stickers that seem to be super glued to the product. I’m going to let the UV rays remove them for me."
positive,Good!
positive,Great for reducing trailer motion in addition to stabilizers.
positive,I bought these so that I can store my stinky slinky in the rear bumper of my camper. I was a little hesitant with the magnetic cap but I stays on the bumper very well. It's very convenient to just pull the cap as well as the sewar hose out with it.
positive,Perfect fit excellent lighting easy to replace and a great value for your money
positive,Came in bulk envelope.  Not organized
positive,"It's the right size (big enough to see, not too big to blanket the side of the vehicle) for installation on an RV, and it has a very robust vinyl surface and effective adhesive. I ould see where someone could easily repurpose this for a different take on the popular scratch off maps and keep it, well, indoors. The squeege inclusion is thoughtful (no bubbles) and the gift certificate for the custom photos-to-state-stickers is nice (it occurred to me to edit the picture to obscure the code right before I hit ""submit""). That feature (and obligation) wasn't apparent to me, but the expense is relatively modest, and they give you a head start with the coupon code."
negative,Does not work
positive,This is a solid product for the price asked.
negative,"I tried so hard to research Splash Guards/Mud Flaps for our new Hyundai Tucson Hybrid. It was way more difficult than imagined. Not a lot of brands, auto part stores had the wrong models and little to no reviews. We were supposed to have a big winter storm so we wanted these parts installed before driving in it, and the OEM version of these would have taken a couple weeks to order. Many of the available products on Amazon were not recommended for this particular model, no idea why. That narrowed our options, but this TOPGRIL had fairly good reviews. There is almost nothing for instructions, it is a case or removing the attachment items and placing the mud flaps in place and reattaching. However, the front mounting points use push anchors, but this new kit had none, just a bag of screws. This required me to re-use those original push anchors. The rear mounting points used Philips head screws, but longer than the screws supplied in the bag. So this was another situation of reusing the original OEM screws. I placed the flaps in place and they had multiple gaps against the auto trim. Since there are only two mounting spots for these flaps there is no good way of forcing them in place to stay. The rear flaps have an extra mounting hole molded in, however it is in the wrong place to use it with the OEM mounting hardware. I ended up filling the empty spaces with clear silicone, I just hope that it does not look too odd when dry."
negative,Got this for my son to use with a helmet for riding a moped. He liked it but said it would not fit under the helmet.
positive,"Easy to lift in vertical position. Best price and weight for the size, which is larger than most others.  Buying another one because my son some.ow ended up with it! Great for camping and trips.  Parking made easy with the option to lift it vertically."
positive,What can I say. Works exactly as it should nice  bright color so you can't forget them.  Great price.  Hope I don't need to order more.
negative,Dosent fit my holley air cleaner
positive,"works excellent after 6 mos, PITA to install, but doable."
positive,Love this product!
positive,"Great headlight. Came assembled and ready to go. Yes It could be brighter, yes it could have a better pattern. But its not a $500 light.  Install was very easy, 10 minutes maybe."
positive,I like organazation this works well.
positive,"2007 ram 1500 with the aam 14bolt, 8 lug wheels. These are for the axle at the wheel. Pull the wheel, brake, and hub off and the u joint is right there. Fits perfect. A press will make your life a whole lot easier with getting the old ones out. Clean the hole and use some grease around the new ones to press them in. 2x easier."
positive,Good spouts
negative,"This product sucked. Did not fit the pieces of the vehicle, bling fell off immediately when attempting to fit the pieces to vehicle's pieces, then the pieces just crumbled upon gently removing them from the pieces of the vehicle (radio knows, ignition key point, A/C controls). This is cheaply made and not accurate for the car make, model, and year. I guess for the price (cheaper than Walmart) you can't expect much, too cheap to bother with a return (which could easily be done if I purchased this at Walmart)."
positive,"I’m too lazy to replace the rear seat covers since it requires disassembling the rear seats, but I’m sure the covers will fit just as well as the front seat covers do in my 2014 Forester. I especially like how the head rest covers are separate, leaving accommodation for my rear seat storage panels intact. It also supposedly takes seat airbags into account, which is nice if true.<br /><br />I’ll update this review if durability becomes a problem or if I decide to install the rear seat covers and it is too much of a hassle. The kit comes with mounting hardware for the covers so keep that in mind if you don’t want to potentially cause damage to your rear seats in any way whatsoever regardless of how minor it might be."
positive,They look good.  Front easier to install than the rear.
positive,Worked like a charm in my 2012 Dodge Chrysler 200 =) It's been a month since my husband installed it and there have been no problems so far. I'll update if that changes.
positive,About this for my sister who got a new SUV and she was absolutely thrilled with its versatility. This is a nice quality product and definitely a good value.
positive,This thing is a beast!! Works as intended with extra features that most other devices do not have. Will purchase more of these as the other brands break!!
positive,OEM part worked great!
positive,"The ice scraper end is a bit small, but it does the job."
positive,Great Product
positive,A+ Product! Even works well on windows. Only issue is I will run out of the product soon.
positive,"The StrongArm replacement liftgate supports look just like the factory original units.<br />They were easy to install, and hold the tailgate up with no problem.<br />In fact, they are so strong, I can open the tailgate less than halfway, and the StrongArm supports will do the rest, opening the tailgate fully and holding it there securely.<br />For half the price of the factory supports, it's a great deal."
positive,Great item!
positive,It works
positive,Perfect fit '86 cherokee
positive,Very close to originals.  Just not enough to stay in the panel slot until you pop it back on.<br /><br />A small dab of hot melt or some rtv holds it long enough.
positive,The connectors didn't fit my application. I cut and spliced the wiring and used one of the included connectors rather than attempting to locate the actual connector. It's worked so far.
positive,Very useful
negative,"This cover didn’t even come close to covering my SxS, a Arctic Cat-Wildcat!  However.... 3/4 of the SXS sits under a carport so I managed to cover enough of it to protect the cab and rear storage compartment. So, if you need to cover the entire vehicle I would not recommend this cover. Quality seems good."
positive,Just like oem product. No loss of reception
positive,just what I was looking for
positive,Hard to install.  Had to stretch it out over night.  Then stitch it for an hour. Looks great but feels thin after applying.
positive,I bought this as a gift for my husband. He says it's very comfortable. Great garage stool.
positive,Fit perfect on my Ford 2006 4x4. Bolted right on with the good instructions that cae with it.
positive,"It was a little more work to install than I first thought, but the instructions are accurate. You have to take off the bumper, put the plate on the frame, then reattach the bumper using the new hardware. You need a 14mm socket and end wrench for a backing wrench (or 9/16&#34; is the same size), a 1/2&#34; socket and end wrench, a 10mm socket and end wrench (to remove factory bolts on top), and about 15 minutes. The bottom bolts on the skid plate / bumper are 14mm (9/16&#34;). You have to completely remove the four bolts on top (12mm wrenches) and two on bottom (14mm socket. Nut is welded and no backing wrench is needed. There are six new bolts, the four with 14mm heads are for the back holes and go through the hitch bracket, bumper bracket, and bumper tube. The two with 1/2&#34; heads go through the front holes and small U-shaped brackets that go around the bumper tube. As long as you put the right bolts in the right locations, you're golden."
positive,"Husky liners go in all my vehicles.  Your carpet will thank you and so will your wallet come trade-in time when that vehicle floor looks factory new.  These X-act liners are well made of a flexible but non-slip material that gives overall floor coverage.  Last set I had lasted 6 years and 2 trucks (wouldn't fit the new one) and still looked really good when I traded them with the truck.  Easy to clean, just pull out, wash, sun dry, and return.  This is the first set of X-act liners I've owned and the only downside I see is the lip around the outside is not as pronounced in the rear floor liner.  Not a real problem."
positive,Brig
positive,"We needed a good, strong trailer hitch for our SUV, as we will be moving a lot of rented equipment around in the planting of our spring crop.  The material used is a forged aluminum, used by those building the space shuttle.  The ball mount works for us, as we’ll be going over some rough terrain.  Showing our hitch to the equipment rental folks confirmed that the hitch would be strong enough for our needs."
negative,"Did nothing to the piece I polished with it, maybe it will work on a different metal intje future, but would not order it again. :("
negative,"The packaging arrived all busted up and the bottom of the box had a huge stain where hydraulic fluid was leaking. Got it out and purged the air out of the hydraulic system, went to use the jack and sure enough, it started leaking from around the pistons. Returning it. Looking elsewhere..."
positive,Excellent product to use on my boat for all the electrical terminals protects them very well thank
positive,bolted right up took the code out of my scanner and the engine light immediately turned off. Then the car PAST SMOG IN CALIFORNIA with no problems
positive,Works as described. Will not work on a 7.5 cu ft Vissani Refrigerator per their Tech support.
positive,"The 16” Tiikeri Microfiber towels measure 15 ¼”, have a decent thickness and do a great job cleaning up. These are a little better quality than the 12” microfiber towels I purchased from a local store, but my local store also has true 16” micros for half the price of these.<br /><br />Cons: The Tiikeri Microfiber towels are not competitively priced compared to similar quality from a national chain store.<br /><br />Overall, these microfiber towels have good fiber blend 80% polyester, 20% polyamide and weight of 1.59oz, they clean great, but I can’t bring myself to pay double for similar quality. Put them on sale and I’m in."
positive,This fits perfectly for my ford explorer key fob!
positive,"I recieved this steering wheel about a week ago and I wanted to use it for a while before giving my review. If you're a girly girl then you'll love it. Just enough femininity but not too much. It fits my charger steering wheel well. I have no slippage while turning, It gives me a good grip. I'm sure it will come in handy during winter when it's freezing cold. This would be a great accessory to a teenagers car. But also great for mom's car as well. It has just enough decoration on it, it doesn't look too much. I like it. I was fortunate enough to receive this item for free in return for my honest review"
positive,It was not easy finding a 34 mm nut this is n it and it worked famously
negative,The drive gear and thrust plate fit and work good. The return spring is not the same as OEM - doesn't have enough pressure to function properly. Retaining ring is not correct for the shaft size and groove. Hold on to these old components just in case.
negative,It's massive- says it fits BMW x3 trunk but in fact it would fit a pick up truck trunk.  Would look cheap if you attempted to cut it. Seller pays for return shipping.
positive,"Loved This Product, Excellent Quality!"
negative,"Sellers on Amazon don't wait long after purchase to ask for a review so I must say that I only used the product once so far.  Why 3 stars: It takes a great deal of pressure to get the air supply in contact with my valve stems.  The end of the too is so tightly attached tho that I can't replace it and use my old attachment.  When I do get air to flow, the gauge doesn't always read accurately when I stop filling to check the pressure.  Sometimes it reads as high as 90 and I have to let go and do it again to get an accurate reading.  My truck tires require 80 psi in the rear and 60psi in the front so accuracy is important.  I am still unable to find my old gauge to verify (which is why I bought this 2 in1 gauge) but I'm reasonably certain that my tires are now at the correct pressures.  I am planning to check again today after yesterday's run and will update this review in the future if need be.<br />On the positive side: This product connects air-tight using Teflon tape and it feels good in the hand, especially since I have to push hard.  If the accuracy of the readings improves I may actually become more satisfied with this product.<br />I don't recommend buying or not buying, it may work fine for you."
positive,"This is my second bottle of Adams Detail Spray.  I love using it.  The car looks sooooo good afterwards.  It is easy to apply, smells good, lasts a fair amount of time.  I highly recommend."
negative,It blew back through the plunger. I tried very slowly but bet I got maybe 25% if any into the line.
positive,"I got this product to try to find an improvement to an existing, similar product from a competitor that I have been using for a while but whose prices have been rising. As it turns out this is essentially the same product. It's works well enough compared to the other product but the reality is they are similar enough that I will buy which ever is cheaper at the time and despite rising prices currently that is the other brand. If you prefer this brand, the product is a decent cleaner and conditioner for all plastic, vinyl, and rubber."
positive,Excellent replacement item with great Amazon provider service after erroneous order
positive,Used this to trouble shoot rear air if there was a leak.  Worked good but I had to put different Orings on it other than the supplied rings.  Proved leak in rear section.
positive,Can not beat the price the only problem was the voltage regular did not match to our plug in. So now I have to find one with an oblong plugin.
negative,"The ones I got are nothing like the description nor the pictures for this item. The fasteners that I received are white and are the two part type. In other words they are not &#34;blind&#34; fasteners. They will not work at all for attaching the under engine cover, which is what I bought them for."
positive,Perfect fit
positive,Very easy to install look really nice!
positive,"Really appreciate the hardware that was included with the scissor jacks. All I needed was a regular drill to poke 2 holes in the frame to mount each jack and my hammer drill to install the threaded bolts. Very tight mount. Could have also used bolt and nuts but wasn't necessary. They included everything. Hardest part  was figuring out where to mount the jacks but once that was accomplished, installation was not bad at all. Drills included, sockets included, stick on templates included, crank included (didn't use), and the jacks. All at a great price.<br /><br />Went camping this past weekend. The jacks made a noticeable difference on the rear of the Class C. A great value and product. Don't be afraid to pull the trigger on these."
positive,The only fluid I use for my Torqueshift transmission.
positive,Excellent
positive,For winter use 4 in the rain snow and sleet holds up very well would recommend to others very stylish easy to take care of mr. Gerald Harris
positive,It looks good and leaks very little at the car wash.  The bulkhead bar didn’t fit the rails as tight as I would have liked but it worked.  It’s tight and didn’t need the tension adjusted at all..  I’m satisfied for what I paid
positive,"You can find lots of reviews on 422s on softails, but I'll review here on amazon.com.<br /><br />This is not sold by amazon.com but the seller was great and got it drop shipped for me.  So cudos to him for that and the good communication.<br /><br />Now to the shocks.  My softail deuce was running stock shocks with the lowering bolts mounted.  I'd say it was lowered a good 2.5"" from stock.  I'm 30 and in good health and my lower back was KILLING me from the hard bumps and bottoming out.<br /><br />I used these shocks and at first lowered it about  1.75"" from stock and had the preload set to factory (near softest setting).  Went on a cruise and it was MUCH better than stock.  Better but not perfect. since I didn't have much travel till it hit the bumpstops.  So i raised it higher to about 1.5""-1.6 lower than stock and soften the preload a bit more.  Now i'm happy with the ride, the height, and the look.  I'm about 160 so I wanted lighter preload than most.  They recommend you get 3/4"" sag when sitting on the bike vs. not.  I'm not getting that 3/4"" but closer to 1/2"".  However the bike sags about 1/4""+ from the bikes weight on itself.  I had my bro that's 190 sit on it and it sagged a LOT more.<br /><br />Installation wasn't too bad but getting the nuts off on the rear of shocks will be a pain without the right tools.  3/4 open wrench and hammer did the trick."
positive,Superior strength to the OEM part!
positive,Best way to equalize tire pressure
positive,"My old truck had/has more problems than I can solve, but this tiny battery kicks it over without a lot of fuss and muss.  I am amazed that a cell phone sized battery can pack that much power, but I'm careful not to over-charge it."
negative,"First of all, if you order these throw away the installation clips and screws. Buy some grabber screws and ask a buddy for help. They really didn't fit like they should have but we made them work by  not using the holes in the panel but rather drilling our own holes and a lot of muscle"
positive,"These look amazing. Watched a video online and installed them myself. I did not take the whole grill off.  I popped the front one off ( it won’t be able to be used again, but  the Black Badge snapped right on. Back badge was a bit more work. But did the sun, fishing line and goo gone trick."
positive,"Stays on even through a car wash . . . put it on my license plate rim, looks great and stays on."
positive,Great price. Great product. Fits great.
positive,Great item
negative,Seems to be quality built but no light in the gauge
positive,Fit my Hunting Buddy heater perfectly with room for extra propane tanks.
negative,"It is a little bigger and A LOT thicker than the original badge. I put it on my truck and wired into my center break light, That way it only lights when I hit the break. I thought during the day it looked a little goofy, but not a huge deal. I doubt anyone really noticed unless they were looking for it. The problem is I have had it on there for six months and it is beginning to yellow, it's just cheap plastic and it sun fades fairly quickly, In addition the lights are starting to flicker, I don't know if the wire is getting loose or the lights are failing. Regardless I'm now shopping for a new Mitsubishi badge to replace this.<br />I wouldn't recommend it, It's not bright enough to notice during the day and the product is just cheap."
negative,The container does not match the description on Amazon. There is a small label pasted across the container that does match the the amazon description. The hose is not as advertised. It is not Barricade and it is not Fuel Injection hose. This is a clear attempt to deceive.
positive,Very good product.  Looks beautiful goes on well and adds luxury to any object it is applied.  You won't be disappointed.
positive,Perfect!  Thanks!
positive,I am using it for my mobile work as a massage therapist. It’s perfect ! I do use a basket liner.
positive,Bought the new colder oem plugs for Kia / Hyundai and my car ran terrible even with the correct gap. Went back to Denso factory plugs used in 2013 for the 2.0 runs like new again.
positive,👍🏽
positive,"Fits nicely in the console of my Kia Soul. It's the perfect size for tossing little receipts and whatnot. Seems durable enough, especially the lid I was worried that it would be flimsy but it's really not. And of course the whole thing is super cute and sparkly!"
positive,best price i found anywhere by far. it was easy to install.
positive,"Easy install, fits perfectly, and includes new retainer clips. What else could you want?"
positive,Great cover. I have this on my car in NYC and for three months so far it has been great!!
positive,GREAT VALUE
positive,Seems tighter than other 3/8. Time will tell if I made a good choice for transmission cooling lines.
positive,"Bought these to go with Bosch QuietCast rotors.  Good combination.  They don't come with the wire spreaders so either reuse the ones already on your Pilot or remember to get new ones before you start.  Also, don't forget to pick up some quality silicone paste to lube the metal to metal contacts and the caliper pins."
negative,"Doesn’t fit well, no tabs to help install it, so the foam tape provided shows. It’s a total 🤡 product. Price is the only attraction but you get what you pay for, and let’s just say you pay very little so…. Don’t expect much"
positive,Best car vacuum I’ve had
positive,Good fit
positive,nice
positive,PLEASED
positive,"I bought this for myself and used it once, it is heavy material and weight, kept me dry and I expect it will last many years to come so I bought a set for my wife as well."
positive,"Great multi-pack product. Does the job it's supposed to. Wish they had all white so you could see the dirt better and know when the towel needs to be turned or washed.<br />Get rid of the black ones, or offer them in a pack by themselves."
negative,We have some missing parts
negative,Flimsy and does not keep heat out - very cute to look at!
positive,"Whether you are a professional mechanic or looking for a great DIY tire repair kit, look no further. Comes with basically everything you need to repair a punctured tire. The set itself is very heavy duty and sturdy unlike some of the other lower quality kits out there. It includes enough material to patch many tires so will be handy if you have multiple repairs to make. Everything is packaged nicely in the included case and instructions are included if you are a first timer. I would definitely recommend to a friend!"
positive,installed on my 2005 Yukon XL - gives vehicle a new updated look
negative,Amazon said it fits 2011 Mazda 3 hatchback and it definitely does not fit.  Wiper broke when I tried installing.
positive,"Quick ship,easy installation,fits!"
positive,Brought this for my 2021 CX-5 and it looks and works great (it did have a minor nick on the mat). It was easy to install and I like that the tie downs are still exposed and I can easily reach the side pockets. It also didn’t have an overpowering rubber smell I was able to install as soon as I got it. Works great in my vehicle. I like that it keeps it clean and also is great to keep groceries from sliding.
positive,Looks good east to put on
positive,Perfecto para limpiar los aros de todo tipo.
negative,Too small for f150. Had to return
positive,"These joints last longer than any of the others that I have tried. I am getting easily 5+ years out of them on my jeep. I have a 3"" lift and was eating the regular joints at least once a year."
positive,Works on zerk fittings on U joint that are almost impossible to reach push in until you fill the ball on the zerk go in slightly squeeze grease in and you're done. You have to hold the needle at a slight angle and hold it there and squeeze grease in slowly and it works great.
positive,Just what was needed for the car
positive,Worked as it ahould
positive,just what I needed
positive,With a 14” blade it fit on my Mahindra / Intimidator side by side with glass windshield. I had a spare rear window wiper blade laying around from a car long sold. The blade that came with it was hitting the bottom weather stripping.<br /><br />For the price I could care less about the generic windshield wiper blade that came with it.<br /><br />The arm spring is strong enough to keep the blade up and out of the way at the 3 or 9 o’clock position even over moderate terrain.
positive,Went in fast and work great.  Lift door does not fall on my head!!
positive,"Easy installation, used teflon tape and it went right in.  As far as I know it is doing it's job, but I don't plan to pull it until i winterize in a couple of months."
positive,"Definitely not industrial quality, but good enough and a great price."
negative,The 3 piece set is meh.  I mean it will work. But you can tell they are cheap.  Especially the magnets.<br /><br />On a side note I had to take another star just for triggering my OCD.  They could have make sure the poles of the magnets were oriented correctly.....  I cannot stack the other two in the big one because its magnet is reversed.... Sigh.  O C D TRIGGERED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Any who - if you need something cheap and quick then get em.  Otherwise wait and get a deal on some better ones.
positive,good
positive,"When I bought my Subaru crosstrek, there was no drawer for change until I found this! I just replaced this with my fuse box cover and it fit perfectly!"
positive,"Great item, easy to install or remove.  Will recommend to friends who also have Corvettes."
negative,"I was hoping it wouldn't be ""too good to be true,"" that a motorcycle battery at this low of a price point was good (all the others seemed to be in the $60 to $90 range). Sadly, IT WAS too good to be true. When I received this battery it was not fully charged so I connected it to my Battery Tender<br />and then installed it in my motorcycle. Started right up. Great! Two weeks later when I went to ride my bike, it was completely dead. Nothing, no juice whatsoever. So I connected my Battery Tender to recharge it and lo and behold, it will not recharge now which means it's useless. Save your money and buy a better quality, more expense battery that will not end up being a brick after a short period of time."
negative,"Don't bother, not effective"
negative,"*THE GOOD- The Kenda R/T tires look good, are quiet and were priced better than most.<br /><br />*THE BAD- I purchased 35x12.50R22s. I have a light vibration at certain speeds. I have had the tires balanced twice at two different shops."
positive,"I used this years ago on a car I restored,you could wax it in direct sunlight,and it will wipe right off. I recently rediscovered it on Amazon, I love this stuff."
negative,This thing is nothing more than a steaming hot pile of cow dung. Actually it would be more useful if it was a pile of cow dung. Water sprays out from the sides all over the place. Trying to connect the container back on the nozzle took me about 5 minutes. Nothing but pure frustration
positive,"Item came shipped in very durable packaging and was very easy to open.  The light bar comes in three pieces that connect with a snap and water resistant gasket.  I wouldn't trust this unit to be completely waterproof though.  The wiring is long enough for you run it behind your bumper or frame and allow for a sleek hidden wire look.  All needed hardware is included for mounting via screws or adhesive.  The adhesive is 3M so should have no issues staying put as long as you clean the sight thoroughly as in the instructions.  As for the instructions, they are very vague which may give some people trouble. Just take your time and dry fit everything before screwing into your vehicle body or using the adhesive.  I preferred to use the adhesive as to not have to worry about a place for rust.  I did not like the included splice kit for the back up light.  There were not instructions for how to do a proper splice and the components would not be water right unless you seal it yourself with tape or otherwise.  Even though I know how to do a wire splice, I didn't not connect the back up lamp for this review.  Again make sure you dry fit the light bar because some locations would cause the tailgate to pinch the bar and possibly break it.  The plug fits into a standard trailer 4 pin wiring plug.  The LEDs are actually quite bright and add brake light and turn signal visibility even during the day. Great feature for someone to better see your brake lights for safety.  This bar is nice for a sleek, custom look; but is just lacking detailed instructions and a more secure/watertight back up splice or connection."
positive,"this rain suit is perfect for days hiking with heavy rain, but the material is a little flimsy and seems like it will rip if walking through thick shrubbery.. but what do you expect from a entire rain suit for 20 bucks? this is perfect"
negative,"China-made, generic knock-off in an AC Delco box. Admittedly, the box says, &#34;Made In China (Mainland),&#34; but I pay for AC Delco genuine parts to NOT get knock-off stuff and the part is only marked with a white tag that says &#34;Made In China&#34; and a few numbers. Nothing AC Delco marked on the part in any way. Sending back. I'll pay $10 or more LESS for the same part that doesn't come in an AC Delco box."
positive,Love this product.  Fits perfectly and very useful to hold things.  Very good quality.
positive,Nice
positive,Worth the extra money!
positive,"Love the new style Bar Pad , if you dont have one get one.<br />was able to trim this for my under bar steering stabilizer, and still look good<br />this cleans up easy and doesn't let the dirt make it dull."
positive,just what i needed for my camper jacks with my elec. drill. thx
positive,"Honest review on this molding. Installing was quite easy and it enabled to re-lift and place if you don't get it perfect. Just don't push it down until it is placed right, then use a  towel and push hard to secure it. One thing I noticed is while washer or drying the vehicle, the towel will catch the edges. So, be careful while doing this so you don't accidentally lift an edge. The material looks to be good quality and I think I  would buy it again. The price was great though and that persuaded me to try it. Fast shipping too, which I always like. The carbon coating looks to be good quality, I haven't done a time test, but if you want it to last and look good, probably keep the sun from cooking it. I am pretty happy with the appearance and 2 rolls worked perfect for my application. I gave it 4 only because it can be snagged with a towel during car cleaning."
positive,"It's not super bright like LEDs or Xenon, but definitely an upgrade and the name states."
positive,Made a huge difference at night... Now I can see where I'm going... I only hope they last longer than some of the other types I've tried...
positive,Easy to install. Fits perfectly. great product. Great price
positive,A LITTLE OVER PRICED
positive,They worked but if they were an inch longer they would be easier to seat.
negative,"Very easy to install, however the second cup doesn’t have a sufficient attachment point & the cup sags which doesn’t work very well."
positive,"Like many others I really wanted a 2"" hitch for a bike carrier, I won't ever tow anything. I downsized from a large, gas guzzling SUV to 2014 Honda CR-V so I have a nice bike carrier that is designed for a 2"" hitch. I could use it with an adapter but it would be suboptimal, i.e. wobbly. Besides, Honda wanted over $500 for the small type hitch. Pft...<br /><br />The small type hitch secures with a pin, the full-size 2"" hitch secures with a big-ass bolt so the carrier sits in place like it was a part of the car. Ever seen a bike rack on a car in front of you  that moves around with the bikes on? Yeah, that's the smaller hitch. Sucks. Full-size, 2"" hitch is the way to go if you want a bike carrier.<br /><br />Some really great tips in the reviews here. Make sure to read some of the top reviews before installing this.<br /><br />First of all, the hitch is top notch. Heavy with solid weldings. Your UPS guy will ask you WTF this thing is!<br /><br />But! The packaging is... well, there is none. The super heavy chunk of metal just flies around in a cardboard box. Upon delivery the box was all cut up by the hitch and the edges of the mounting plates were all scratched up. Lucky, this is the invisible part that will be hidden under the car. The bag with the bolts is taped to the hitch, otherwise it would certainly fall out of the holes in the box. One star less for lousy packaging.<br /><br />Just installed it this morning and just to confirm what other said. Nothing is particularly difficult or hard about the installation and the included instructions are excellent, Curt really did a great and detailed work on the instructions. How easy it is will depend on your strength since the hitch is very heavy. Getting it up was the hardest part for me, since I'm not very strong. I'm a cyclist, I have no upper body strength :)<br /><br />First though:<br /><br />- Get a roll of gorilla tape.<br />- Get a fresh, sharp blade for a utility knife.<br />- Get a torque wrench with a 9"" extension.<br />- You do NOT need a Dremel for this.<br />- You do NOT need to raise the car unless you are a very large person.<br />- Wear safety glasses as crap WILL fall down on your face.<br />- Make sure the car is cold, no fun working around a hot exhaust pipe and a muffler<br /><br />Without a torque wrench you will likely NOT tighten the bolts enough. Even with a long handle of the wrench I had to pull really hard to get the specified torque.<br /><br />As many reviewers already pointed out: there is absolutely NO need to remove the plastic underside panel. I'm glad, because based on my previous experience with removing such panels it sucks: it's time consuming and it's impossibly hard to put them back on. The plastic is soft, barely thicker than the bottles engine oil comes in. A sharp utility knife cuts through it without much effort and there is nothing to be damaged on the other side, no fuel lines, no cables, nothing. You will save yourself at least 30 minutes or more and hell of a lot of frustration.<br /><br />Cut the opening an inch larger in each direction than the instructions say and only cut it on three sides, leaving the side facing the left side of the car (away from the muffler) uncut. Bend the cut plastic away and hold it in place with a piece of gorilla tape. Later, let it fall back in place and just make a cutout for the hitch and tape it all back in place with the gorilla tape.<br /><br />Under the plastic there is some fluffy, cotton-like stuff, just cut it on three sides like the panel and do not remove it. Tuck it back in place after the hitch is bolted and before taping the panel back. It's probably there for a reason.<br /><br />Yeah, DO NOT remove the plastic panel completely, it's there for a reason. Some engineer though it should be there, otherwise the nice finance people at Honda would be happy to save few bucks and the panel wouldn't be there, hm? But it's there. Hint: it's right under the gas tank.<br /><br />There was some rubbery white goo in the holes on the muffler side I had to pick it out with needle-nose pliers and clean the holes with steel brush. I drove the bolts into all four holes just to make sure they're clean to avoid surprises when I'm trying to bolt the actual hitch.<br /><br />Definitely use some WD40 on the rubber pieces that hold the muffler. I gave it a few minutes to penetrate and then just removed them both by hand, no special tools needed.<br /><br />Someone suggested to hang the hitch first with the u-bolt and man, thanks for that tip! Saved a lot of cursing as I would not be able to hold the hitch with one hand while bolting the plates to the frame. No freaking way! This worked great, but it was still pretty hard to lift the hitch up to the u-bolt. Once the hitch is hanging in the middle by the u-bolt it's trivial to drive the four bolts into the car's frame.<br /><br />Then tighten the 4 bolts with a torque wrench, hang the muffler back, again that can be easily done with your hands only. Then release the plastic you cut out, make a cutout for the hitch, tuck the fluffy stuff back, tape the plastic with gorilla tape.<br /><br />Now tighten the two bolts on the u-bolt and you're done. Don't worry about the u-bolt being centered, if you tighten the nuts with a torque wrench to exact value of 50lbs/ft the bolt will self-center.<br /><br />Total time? Maybe 45 minutes including getting all the tools together and cleaning up afterwards. I used blue Loctite on all bolts. I'm a huge fan of Loctite.<br /><br />I'm 5'11"", 200lbs and I had no problem getting under the car to do the cutting and to remove the muffler hangers without lifting the car.<br /><br />It's true what others said that the hitch sticks out, about an inch. Whether that can get you in trouble with the law, I have no clue. But you will definitely leave a nasty mark on any car you back into."

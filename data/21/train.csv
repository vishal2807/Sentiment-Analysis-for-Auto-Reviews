negative,"Crappy knockoff. Didn't work for my vehicle,  vendor offered 30% discount in lieu of return to China but never received."
positive,"Does as it is advertised.  For best results, let it set over night before using your leather item."
positive,"Perfect fit, sealed well."
negative,"The light is white, but the light output is horrible. At best it lights just about 10-15 yards in front of you and it’s quite dim."
positive,"I have bought shades for my automobiles in the past but never have spent the money on a fitted shade. That is one design specifically for my automobile. With the recent purchase of my new car, I made the investment and so glad I did. It fits  like the proverbial glove"
negative,It fit in  my ram 3500 2012. But the hole for one of the sensors was off. I had to ream out my plastic housing on the sensor (not cool) and it’s still got a little gap on the connection. 30 min drive no engine lights on. So fingers crossed. This pipe is HOT! Now I’m looking into a heat shield or even some heat tape. Do not ruin your engine thinking this is all you need. I am keeping it because I don’t want to pay four hundred bucks for what I just took off of there though.
positive,"It's perfect it's exactly as it looks, extremely strong, very durable and exactly as it is advertised. You can't go wrong with these"
positive,I got this for my daughter's laptop and she couldn't be happier with it. It's nice it's big and it's just a really well-made.
negative,"Bought this to use on a 2006 Dodge 3rd generation Cummin's.  The puller bolt holes line up just fine with the CP3 drive gear...however the puller bottoms out on the timing cover before it pushes on the pump shaft.  This is worthless as it sits.  I did modify it by drilling and tapping a 3/8 hole to use a bolt to push out the pump shaft.  I managed to get the puller to work as modified to complete my job,  however I cannot recommend this puller as it is."
positive,needed to protect wiring harness fro excess heat from header pipes and cylinder head
positive,Fits perfectly.  Really blocks out the sun and heat well.
positive,It worked n I'm bought! I'm very  glad to  have found this product.
positive,"I've been bleeding the brake fluid in our Lexus/Toyota every 2 years as recommended in the manual.  Bleeding brake lines is a painful and time consuming job.  It usually takes me 2 1/2 hours (and get someone to step on the brake for me.)  This testing tool helps me realize that my brake fluid is still in pristine condition and does not need to be changed.<br /><br />To make sure that this tool is functioning, I added a little water to a bottle of brake fluid on purpose and shook it.  The tester detected the moisture."
positive,Great
positive,Direct replacement for our 2022 CRV Hybrid. Easy to install. No issues.
positive,Great product
positive,I just installed these.  Install was easy.  They look pretty good.  There are some gaps but to be expected.  They can't fit every car perfectly.  I have a 2019 Chevy Volt.  If you look at the photos you can see how the headrest cover straps go around the back of the headrest and how the base is attached by pulling the clips through the gap between the seat bottom and the seatback.  The front is attached by two hooks that need to be attached to something under the seat.  There are some defects that I doubt will come out as they are very deep divots made by the clips during shipping.  My only real concern is how they will handle the heated seats and whether they will deteriorate and put residue on the seats.  Time will tell.
positive,Replaced the valve on my portable tank.  This bolted right up and is working perfectly
positive,So much suction so great
positive,The fit is perfect
positive,"Only one strut on our 2014 Forester failed but I replaced them both, using an old mop handle to hold up the manual hatch during installation. It took about 25 minutes for the set and after a few months, they're still working great. They were shipped separately and arrived several days apart."
positive,"Works great. Wish I didn't have to butt splice any wires for an OEM part, but works flawlessly."
positive,"I've had the All-top compressor for about a month. I have only used a few times but so far, I'm impressed! It inflates tires quickly, a lot quicker than any portable I've had before. It does get hot but any portable compact compressor does. Seems well built."
negative,Lasted about 3 months.  Broke cheap pos
positive,Easy to install..and works great
positive,Very easy to install
positive,I use these on my boat and they've been out in all kinds of weather and they work fine
positive,They work.
negative,"After looking up and ordering for my daughter's 2009 honda civic, disappointed that it isn't high enough. One of a few birthday presents. Fail"
positive,The compressor is very noisy  but it works
negative,"Bought to save power in RV.  Touchy to install, as I had to bend out the wires on re-install several times to get a good connection.  The emitted light was noticeably more /bluish than OEM filament lights.  Maybe as bright or a little brighter, but not at alla pleasant color for indoor use."
positive,"We have been &#34;managing&#34; for two or more years with having to lift the back hatch (door) of our minivan. I've held it open with my head while my hands put boxes in the back.<br /><br />Now, no need for any herculean efforts! I loved it that Strong Arm sent me an email with video. The video helped me understand what I was going to be facing. I even got customer support, by phone, for a question in the middle of the replacement job."
positive,Great
positive,"no issues, works well. thanks"
positive,"Installed this item on my 1997 F250 Diesel, that would not start on cold mornings without plugging in the warmer for about 2 hrs.  Installed this switch in about 5 minutes.  Solved my cold morning start problem."
positive,Great product and fast delivery. Look forward to next time
positive,Well made and look good too.  They work perfectly for running my 12v deep cycle batteries in parallel on my RV.  Very happy.
positive,"I can tell this is good wax, but what a pain to remove. Don't wait for it to dry, remove it pretty quickly after application."
positive,very nice
negative,I have been trying to install them for weeks. They just don’t work on my Jeep Renegade.
positive,"Bought these, and yep, they are some nice shackles. they work great and got me out of a hole. remember kids, never use tow straps with hooks on them. use tow straps with these."
positive,"I used to throw a towel over the seat to keep from sweating on the seat after a workout.  I now use this product.  After a week or two I throw it in the wash.  It fits the car seat reasonably well for being a ""universal fit"".  The only downside is the rubber backing (essential to stop sweat from reaching the seat) also results in your back sweating even more (like wearing a rubber suit would do)."
positive,Easy to install and the adhesion is great.  They look like they came from the factory.
positive,great product fast shipping
positive,Large enough to keep an old man from falling & extremely durable.
negative,"If you already own a multimeter, you can look up on google/youtube how to use it to do the same thing, but better because you have actual voltage values and not just colored lights. This instrument does not do a load test - go to your parts store, they do load tests for free."
positive,"the sharpness of an air horn is not there, but it is distinct enough that surrounders know you are there, which is desirable in traffic."
positive,Needed for my husbands nebulizer - fine.
positive,"The guide it provided gave a wrong instruction for my vehicle, but the issue it created wasn't enough to keep it from working."
negative,They don't seem to stay in the seats very well.  I'm constantly adjusting them.
positive,If you do it carefully and right you'll be happy. It's amazing!
positive,"works great, the mitt makes cleaning so easy and the guard really keep dirt at the bottom"
positive,"Bought this many times and never had any issues, dont take a chance and try to save a few bucks cuz it could cost you big."
positive,Instructions were easy to follow and the old struts were easy to remove. The new ones clipped right in and I immediately saw a difference.
positive,"Definately Navy and Yellow, not gold. Picture looked like gold color to me."
positive,Used on a 2012 Chevy Sonic
positive,Use a work on small engine
positive,"This was a great purchase. Not only did the light assembly fit exactly like the original, but it also came with bulbs! I saved myself over $200 by purchasing the assembly this way and not through Jeep and by installing it myself (quick YouTube video). I recommend this product!"
positive,Well packaged. Arrived intact. The application and fit was good.
positive,Good fit
positive,"What can I say, ACDelco - original part.  Great price, install was easy.  Check Engine light came on the day after I installed it - but I hear that is common.  Independant testing rated this better - for particle protection - than K&N, so I'm good with it."
positive,Best thing I ever bought for my Ford. I have a 2018 Ford F150 XLT 5.0L. I wanted to do my own oil change and found out that it will be super messy. I watched a few videos and everyone of them were messy. Someone said twist the yellow plastic drain plug (which I will never understand why plastic) and slowly twist it til the oil slowly comes through. Then hold it for 2 minutes. Doesn't work. I suggest hold it longer than 2 minutes. Like 5 minutes. I know to long but will be less of a mess. Anyway. Bought the Ronin because I've seen videos and many people recommend it. The price is high but it does exactly what it is designed to do and the name is pretty awesome (Ronin). The material is made of billet and you can never go wrong with that. It is only made for Fords that have the dreaded yellow drain plug. I recommend it to anyone that does not what to continue to have a mess. Buy it. You will be happy you did and it looks pretty great when it is installed.
positive,"I love these things. Ours are mainly used for drying dogs after winter walks in BC Canada. They're very absorbtive, if that's a word. Our front loader washer usually has a small puddle of water in the door seal, which gets to smelling old and moldy. Sticking one of these in the seal 'pool,' and letting the end hang out of the opening, wicks away the pools and evaporates the water. Presto change-o no moldy smell."
positive,Great! Fits great and gets the job done!
positive,This set up is great. Comes with everything you need for the job.
positive,"Fits 2011 dodge Journey well no problems, fast and easy"
positive,This device worked first try on my 2004 Audi A4 1.8T Quattro 6-speed manual. I use the Torque app on my Motorola Razr HD.
positive,"High quality filter, first my 2018 civic perfectly. Will definitely be purchasing again."
positive,Motorcycle
negative,"I’m surprised that this has so many good ratings. I purchased two of these and I’m really disappointed. The padding in the middle is supposedly for the back, but it hits myhips instead, so it has the opposite effect that it’s supposed to. Essentially, my hips are being pushed forward, creating a flatter back than a normal cover. I already tossed the original packaging so I can’t even return them. Lesson learned!"
negative,"Battery was too low to charge, sometimes the charger said charged, sometimes the charger said bad battery. I know the battery is weak, that's why I wanted a charger...."
positive,"This decal comes with standard paper backing plus a clear covering, which makes it very easy to apply without bubbles or trouble.  Looks just right on my Lotus 7 roadster project.  Shipping was reasonably fast, but two days later than an Amazon fulfilled item ordered at the same time, and the seller offered no tracking information."
positive,Fits perfectly. Leaves room underneath for taller items. Glad I got the cheaper one because it’s perfect.
positive,Fits my Nissan Sentra 2009. There is a strong rubber smell when you open the package but goes away after a day or so. Very thick and stay in place.
negative,"They cut the bag open, charged me for 4 pens, and sent me one pen. Not a good deal at all. Inaccurate description. Sending it back."
negative,Missing clips to hold the tag on the tag holder.
positive,Everything in my SUV said I needed a new catalytic converters. 3.6 v-6  GM engine 138k miles. Changed out the o2 sensors reset the codes. Added a can to a full tank of gas twice. Reset the codes again. Engine purrs like a kitten & no more engine light codes for the past month.
positive,"With cold engine, used a turkey baster to suck-out about a 1/2 pint of antifreeze mixture from the top of my radiator -- mashed-up 4 of the tablets (I have a 2 gallon cooling system) in hot water (per instructions on stop leak product)... once completely dissolved, I poured the hot water/pellet solution into the radiator, and replaced the cap -- ran engine until hot per the instructions on the stop leak product --- within several days, no more antifreeze smell coming from the engine after we stopped and parked -- seems to have worked well.  The radiator tank has stopped loosing water on a regular basis.  RB"
positive,i love this parallax adjustment wheel .  this a game changer for me.
positive,Figured it out easy enough. Did not however have instructions. Metal seems a bit cheap - dented in when screwing in.
positive,"so far, great"
positive,"wow, this arrived so quickly and is so sturdy and well made.  I mean, it has to be for what it's designed for, but you never know with online ordering sometimes.  Part of what attracted to me to this set was mostly the price, but also the various well made caps and coverings for when this is not in use.  Also, I'm sure the detachable key parts will come in handy for those looking for a theft deterrent.  I am not using this for an auto project, so it will be visible in my application.  it's silly, but i also bought this because the keys come in different colors and you get all of them.  So great that it matches my set up, even if its just a battery disconnect.<br />."
positive,Ok
negative,"out put hose is not long enough to fit into the receiving tank on most cars while the 5 gal can is sitting on the ground.  I had to use 2 milk cases(about 2 ft) to lift the gas can off the ground so hose would fit into the tank on my Jeep Liberty.  Not sure why unless they expect you to hold a 40 lb gas can up against your car with one hand while putting the hose into the tank with the other--stupid! And it leaks! And it leaks!! not sure where but you may end up with a puddle of gas on the ground!  As it leaks, it will empty the gas can into the gas tank in a few minutes(just stand aside so your shoes don't get wet with gas!  So, I guess it works with all its failings but I would not recommend."
positive,"Gear shifts are much smoother - I no longer experience the jerks when the box changes gears. And I haven't been using cheap oil.<br /><br />Temperature of the gearbox seems to be about the same - I don't think I experienced any drop in temps as claimed by some, but this is just using my &#34;hand&#34; sensor."
positive,"This arrived as promised and is consistent with the description. I am just starting to use the trash can, so I have not had any issues with leaking. Additionally, I am using a small plastic bag in the trashcan to avoid messy clean-up. The biggest issue was that I could not attach it to my console easily, so I just sat it behind the console. If it doesn't work in the current location, I can hook it to the back of one of my seats."
positive,This is out second set. We bought them for the front of our jeep and when we put on a new back bumper we bought the same ones. They are great. Very sturdy and no rust.
negative,This is the model number and item according to the website and it did not even come close to working. Needless to say that was money lost!!! Someone needs to double-check crap before it is posted. This was extremely misleading!!!
positive,It was a perfect fit. Everything was just as advertised. I would definitely use this company again.
positive,"Easy to install. (Do be sure to unplug the washer first!) Remove the old module, then connect the new one. You’re done!"
positive,another layer of security
positive,All good
negative,"They're alright, and certainly acceptable for the cost.  No polarization though; you'll get the glare."
positive,"***Original Review from 3/31/14***<br />Solid roof rack, I trust it to hold in place and it held up well on a 3 hour drive each way to the ski mountain. The positioning of the stands was a little difficult to understand from the directions and I was not able to match their spacing on the back rack. A little adjustment though and it works perfectly. Seems pretty easy to remove and reattach. Docking one star because of the difficulty in initial configuration.<br /><br />***Update 8/6/18***<br />I have been using this roof rack for over 4 years now to carry a Thule Ski box during the winter and our two 16' sea kayaks in the summer. The first couple of years I only left the roof racks on the car when they were being used. For the 3rd and 4th years I got lazy during the winter and left them on until the spring. This caused one side (the passenger side under the ski box) to corrode the screws and now the attachment points are stuck and can't be loosened/tightened. The other side still adjusts so it can be attached/removed, just with more difficulty. I have definitely used and abused this roof rack and it has held up pretty well. Overall I would recommend this rack to other Prius C owners."
positive,well made
positive,Great fit for a 2021 Mazda CX-5. Nice looking and great value. Would definitely buy again.
positive,"Nothing bad about it, but another seller was a let down since the handle that came in broke but this one works great, probably a little touch up of can spray paint to color match the car, and boom! perfect."
positive,Awesome products
negative,"Needed something to get me to 12-14psi, 15 max. Adjusted all the way out, I can only get pressure down to 33psi. Probably excellent for people who need a constant 60psi for a Sniper or something, but not really for lower pressure (no way to get it anywhere near 0-psi)."
positive,Perfect replacement bolts for my YUASA battery.
positive,Works well
positive,"Works great! Keep in mind that it's a one time use (it couldnt be resealed). So if you have a bunch of things that need to be glued ~ now is the time!<br />There probably IS a way to close off each tube, but I didnt want to risk it.  Just toss it."
positive,"Belt fits my truck and runs quietly.  We'll see how long the belt lasts . . . replaced original at 112,000 miles.  Never changed a belt before and it took approximately 1 hour by myself because I removed the skid plate below . . . looked easier than trying to change from above.  Probably could have finished in 20 minutes if I had changed one before.  I also recommend buying one of the long bars for changing belts (can attach socket to it) . . . made the job much easier."
negative,I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THIS WAS FOR -ONLY A CAR DRY SHINE.?? -SO IT IS ONLY FOR A CAR.
positive,"I’ve had these brake lines installed on a 1996 F250 for about a year and they’ve performed perfectly. I’d consider myself “somewhat handy” and it took me a couple hours on Saturday & Sunday for back-to-back weekends to install all of them. They’re pretty stout and stainless steel should hold up for awhile but I can’t really speak to the durability.<br /><br />Overall, get these for $190 and never hafta worry about brake lines agin. I’ll be buying a set for my Bronco soon."
negative,Fit just fine.<br />But only lasted 15 months. ABS wires both broke off after 11 months.<br />Would not recommend at all.
negative,Finished instructions and there is no strobe. Returning. Nice size and brightness just wish they did what they said they do.
positive,works
positive,Fits very well and really comfortable to ride in.
positive,"I have a 17-year-old Dodge 3500. Recently when I went to charge the batter the hood support struts gave out and the hood slammed down onto me, nearly breaking my arm. Not an experience I'd like to repeat. Even though I changed out the struts, I picked this up as an extra safety measure. It's small, easy to use, and fits in my glovebox so it'll be available whenever needed. It comes with a paper warning ribbon so that you won't forget to undue it before closing the hood, which is nice, but would have had more utility if it were something more robust like plastic or cloth, but I can remember to remove it easily enough so that's not a problem for me. The only real downside is that when tightened down it does scratch the surface of the strut. If they put a rubber coating on the end of the bolt I'd give it 5-stars in a heartbeat. Nevertheless, I'm glad I got it."
negative,I agree with the other reviewer that noted this filter is somewhat flimsy in its construction.  The rubber seal around the edge looks like it could pretty easily fall off.  The only reason I didn't give it fewer stars is because the OEM filter it is replacing was also pretty flimsy.
positive,installed in my 12 bolt type O rearend
negative,I am very suspicious of many of these reviews. Most of them do not even state which model (weight capacity) they purchased.
negative,Mine failed despite having never touched/used the convenience nut. I started noticing a burning smell from down below and it led me to the leak. It caused a bit of mess there.<br /><br />This one's a 'Do not buy'
positive,This thing saved me a ton. Break lights didn't come on. Works perfectly now. As side from that my transmission is switching to the low gears again. Apparently this switch sends a signal to the transmission to downshift. I didn't know that so 2 birds with one stone. Highly recommended.
positive,fit easy
negative,"The adhesive on this shield is Super-weak. I put it on the hood of my car which it's made for, and it fell off on my way to the store, just after mounting. Luckily, my daughter discovered it while riding her bike. You're going to need to use some JB Weld or another adhesive if you'd like to keep this on your vehicle."
positive,"I bought this to check my tire pressure and after it said the PSI was 20, 15, 17 and 18 I for sure thought it had to be faulty because my air pressure couldn’t possibly be 15 when the recommended is 32. To check the accuracy, I took the pressure on my grandma’s SUV because her car tracks the PSI and I just filled it up last week. I test hers, 31.8, 31.8 32, and 31. I check what her car says and lo and behold, all the tires are at 32 so it was exactly right and .2 off so on one hand I’m happy with the accuracy but on the other hand I’m a little floored that the tire pressure on my car really is 15. This little thing works great and reads super fast."
negative,"On the plus side, this is easy to apply. It has a semi-thick cream consistency that spreads easily and, if applied with a sponge or foam applicator (not included), can easily get into any nooks and crannies in the rim, or any other metal object being polished. There is no objectionable smell. The bottle has a wide-tipped applicator nozzle that dispenses an ample amount but not so much that it gets wasted or makes a mess.<br /><br />The hard work comes when removing it. It takes a lot of elbow grease to get the polishing compound removed completely. I used a micro fiber towel (not included) and, while it was nice to see all the black gunk that the polishing compound was removing from the rim, it took 10+ minutes and two towels to completely remove the polish.<br /><br />The end result was nice -- a sparkling shine. However, I can get the same level of shine with other rim polishing products with a LOT less effort.  While I can't fault the end results, it's not a product I would get again since I can get the same results with a lot less work. As it is, I gave up after two wheels since it was so much work.<br /><br />This might be a good choice if you have an electric buffing wheel to cut down on the amount of hand labor for polishing. But, if you're applying and removing by hand, this is not an ideal product unless you are willing to put in a fair amount of work."
positive,dosent fit flush maybe with a few tweaks
positive,I love it.
positive,Does a great job.  Display could be brighter hard to rea in bright light.  Otherwise it does an excellent job.  Add 7-8 lbs in 3-4 minutes automatically.  Displays pressure as it is added.
negative,feels loose when I assemble and it does not work
positive,works great
negative,"Would probably work great if it wasn't for the poorly made air hose screw-in tube tip. You have to quickly unscrew and remove it after you've inflated the tire, and there's pretty much no way to do that quickly enough to not lose 10 lbs. of pressure while you are doing it. What happened to the old style that had a flip top that prevented leaks? I had one of those for 10+ years and loved it. This one is a piece of junk. Just not at all practical. You have to over-inflate the tire tube by at least 10 lbs to get it where you want with the leakage, which puts the tube at risk of popping."
positive,Part works perfectly at a very good price. My 26 year old daughter installed by herself with no mechanic experience.
positive,These bulbs are bright and fit perfectly for my application in my Chevy Cruze.I have had no issues with DOA however I have not used all of them. I would recommend them for the price and quality. Your car will look personalized. My issue was with shipping and that is covered under that review. This is a great product and I will buy more from them for my other vehicles.
positive,Smell is very strong
positive,"Great cov we r for your luggage, fit perfectly and keeps you luggage from getting scuff marks as it goes through the airport terminals to final destination.  Highly recommend for protecting luggage."
positive,"Product was perfect for what I needed.  However, thanks to You Tube for have a video showing the need to pull the headliner.  Overall I would have gave it a 5 star, but I think it was a little pricey."
positive,Nice.
positive,works great
positive,"Fit my truck perfectly, very easy to install. Folds up and down easily, protects bed in all weather."
positive,"I really like the center tray for the info center! This tray is perfect for getting phones and other things up out of the way and keeping the area clutter free! There are some sizing issues with it though (see photo). However, that is not a big deal!  The arm rest console tray seems to be a little bit of an afterthought. It is quite deep and has a lot of play inside the console. There also isn't a good grab handle to lift it out of place. The instructions for the Velcro was quite lacking.  However, I will try to use both for a time to see how I like it. Overall, not too bad of a purchase because it provides some needed storage organization to the Rav4! My wife will like them both for sure!"
positive,I could gave more stars!!!Excellent.I look's more better than the picture. I purchase one back on 2015...and it still works!!
positive,I bought this to keep the water lines clear at the barn. Frozen lines is no fun! I have only used it once but it is easy to use. I blew out a huge chunk of ice the first time I tried it! I anticipate that it will prove to be a good investment and time-saver!
positive,Fit my Black & Decker trickle charge perfectly. Good medium duty cables
positive,Driven about 500 miles since installation. Works flawlessly so far. I dig having this ECM in my car.
positive,Sticker is of great quality so far. Arrived earlier than expected
positive,What a simple idea that works very well.  Takes 5 minutes to install (no tools needed) and lifts the back shelf every time I open the trunk.
positive,"Awesome product, and easy to program."
positive,It works and it's a perfect fit.
positive,I bought this at my son's request.  He is happy with it.  It does the job.
negative,"This is the fourth Metra Dash kit that I have installed.  I have been pretty pleased with the other ones (Lexus GX 470, Toyota Celica),  but this kit is really awful.  As others have mentioned,  you will need to remove  the center bar on the trim ring.  Really?  It would have cost them 2 cents to throw in another ring without the bar.  Instead I spent 15 minutes filing it down with a Dremel trying not to make it not look like aftermarket junk.  Nearly every piece of plastic in my kit was badly warped.  Nothing wanted to snap together and stay together.  In the third picture you can see where the bracket snaps into the surround. The male piece was square and too large to seat properly (only on one side though).  I used some end cutting pliers and a Dremel to cut it down.  The Faceplate was badly warped (see pics).  I ended up using a heat gun to straighten it out the best I could. Like others mentioned, I had to cut the bottom of the mounting bracket (behind the faceplate)  in order for my Binize Double Din Android to fit inside the mount.  I cut and hacked at this thing for hours.  What should have been a 35 minute job took me nearly three hours to get it to the point where I would not be embarrassed by someone asking my daughter who installed her stereo.  I looked around at other kits, and don't think any of the other ones would be any better.  I would definitely pay $50 or more for a good kit, unfortunately it looks like we don't have many options for this old girl (we've owned her 15 years - my car handed down to my daughter).  I cannot imagine a stereo shop using one of these for an install. The labor required to make it fit would kill them.  The unsatisfied customers would put them out of business.  So sad this wasn't as good as their other kits.  I hope this review and my pics help you out."
positive,Seems well made so far
positive,Good cheap tire pressure guage
positive,Love it
negative,I always replace headlight bulbs in pairs.  One of them already burned out after just 6 months.
negative,"We have tried to use this serveral times because of the winter months, when static electricity is present due to the dryness of the air. We have tried to put it in one hand or the other, tried to hold it while touching equipment..etc<br /><br />Both my wife and myself have been shocked every time we had it with us.<br /><br />Other than a neat looking keychain it does nothing for static electicity"
positive,I installed this on my 2009 Mitsubishi Galant which was very easy and fit. Stops the car with little to no pressure. And stop instantly. I was hesitant about getting them but once I got it for an amazing price and great quality it’s worth it. I recommend.
positive,good
positive,Perfect fit
positive,Like it. Does what I need and wanted.
positive,"This is easy to use, cleans fast and doesn’t smear windows."
positive,The window shades work fine.
negative,Just received this today only to find out that the 2014 Road King FLHR headlamp harness runs under the fuel tank. The harness provided in the daymaker kit is nowhere near long enough. I did not pull the tank to see how far or what type of connector it uses (if any). I’m pretty bummed that I have to return the daymaker.
negative,Has a very short range.
negative,"My '99 truck plastic handle-pull broke, I was convinced that the entire door handle housing was made of plastic.<br />I ordered this replacement 2 years ago and was not surprised that this unit was ALL plastic.<br />Two years later I'm finally getting around to this project and realizing that ONLY the handle PULL on the OEM part is plastic. The actual OEM housing is still made of Metal, just like the sturdier 1994 model.<br />Now I am having some serious concerns about how long this FULLY PLASTIC housing with a metal insert for the screws is going to LAST. 🙄<br /> I would highly recommend looking elsewhere or even getting the genuine GM part if necessary to get the metal housing.<br />This is not a job you want to redo every 6 months.<br /> I would even go further to suggest using a 1994 unit which also has the METAL handle PULL as well as the metal housing.<br />Especially for the driver's door which gets used the most.<br />Plastic is just NOT up to some jobs,<br />Sad...but reality.<br />UPDATE : Further into the install , the lock cylinder is backing out during installation. It hasn't even made it to actual use.<br />I'm going to try something mother said never to do...get super glue near a lock cylinder.<br />Also having a problem with the rubber seal is seems to be too small to surround  the outer rim of the handle, like it needs to be stretched.<br /> Once again, another one-shot superglue was necessary to hold the seal in place, at least for installation.<br />This is probably one of my 3 worst purchases from Amazon in 20 years.<br />If a metal housing is not going to holdup, how long is a plastic housing going to last??<br />My neighbor has a 2013 GMC, his door handle must be full plastic. It's been broken for at least 4 years (this is 2022). At least my metal/plastic  hybrid lasted for 19 years.<br />But the '94 is still like new!"
positive,great tires
positive,great
negative,It covers up the state name on my license plate which is illegal so I can’t uss it.
negative,"First off at one third of the cost of an OEM you can not expect perfection, that being said: you bend the three support arms which mount to the hood. Do the center first, temporarily bolt on to determine which way to bend the other two. Do one of the outside, bolt on, then check the third. Take your time and I used my vice to get the bends perfect. Also the 3 holes drilled for the hood latch release were way off. I drilled new holes right through and used # number 10 bolts with washers and nylocks as opposed to the self tapping design Mopar. Expect to spend around 90 minutes making this bracket fit perfectly...Still at the price point it is worth buying if your OEM bracket has rotted away."
positive,This is the only 3 gallon container that I could find.
positive,Works perfectly with separate Rhino cross bars I ordered.
positive,It’s not easy to fold and store.  I do like it’s shade it give.
positive,"Works well, easy to install, holds up well (so far)."
positive,good item
positive,I purchased these windshield washer replacements for my 2009 Saturn Outlook.  They were extremely easy to replace by myself. Would recommend.
positive,Works perfectly
positive,Heavy material. Look really nice.
positive,Good
positive,"So as mentioned in other reviews, I have to agree and comment that the zippers are indeed very stiff and somewhat difficult to zip when on top off the roof. That said, it was 100% waterproof as we drove through several hours of pounding rain as we headed toward the Beach. We were able to fit two folding sport chairs, two boogie boards, a Beach umbrella, the Beach bag with 5 Beach towels, and a Beach blanket in the carrier. It is a tad smaller than one I borrowed last year. This carrier at 13 cubic feet is noticeably smaller than the 15 cubic feet units."
positive,No really! It works great!
positive,"Flimsy, hard to keep cover on"
positive,Lights were easy to install and are plenty bright!
positive,"it's not as thick as my last one but I'm happy with it. it's still not completely unrolled at the end, but it's getting there. I have a toolbox in the bed that used to fly around in there and bash into the walls, it hasn't moved since I put this liner in."
positive,"Old starter was struggling for quite a while, I was going to drive it until it was completely dead.  Low and behold it died on me.  It took me 20 minutes to get the old one off and 15 minutes to get this one in.  Started right up!  Have been running it for about two weeks in the cold weather we are having and there is no hesistation!"
positive,Buen material
positive,Perfect fit 2012 Kia Sedona
positive,Works as expected.
positive,Came fast and as described
positive,It's WeatherTech never gotten anything bad from them
positive,Great quality and easy install
positive,fit great
positive,"Just wrote a review for my HD sneakers, white, they get marked up easily because they’re white. This keeps my shoes looking great and I hardly notice it’s there."
positive,Put one on the left frt and one on the right frt of my car. i live in the south west and these domed decals are grt!!!<br />Better quality than I thought i would get.<br />I will buy all my domed stuff here.
positive,"I loved the product, and service.."
positive,This was bought for a 2007 SAAB 9-3 and it fit perfectly!
positive,[[VIDEOID:908638902c91cd52cfa2bbf4f6368c17]] I like how it organizes the cables making it easy to charge the car and unwind.
negative,Do not waste your money on these rotors or brake pads. Worst product I have purchased replaced all hardware pads and rotors they make more noise now than they did. There is no way these are balanced that’s a complete lie. I sound like a radio flyer wagon with no wheels coming down the road. It’s almost like every rotor is warped or not true the pads rub rotors while just rolling with no brakes. I did the whole break in procedure and that did absolutely nothing. So do not deal with this company I want a refund if I could give negative stars I would stay with OEM these are coming off and getting replaced also my rims are covers in dust because the rotors are not true or balanced like they say
negative,Never have i spent so much on plugs that will not work with this mushroom plug gun. So far three different sets of plugs with no success for a plug what works with the smaller tip. The small tip ID is .190 the OD is .250 Where does a person get the correct plug for this smaller tip?
positive,Bought these for my F150.  Love them.  I ski during the winter and spring and these are great for protecting.
positive,Convenient container for travel. One could use bleach and find a way to package themselves. For a few bucks I'll let them package it.
positive,I used this tool on a 97 4Runner timing belt replacement project. It made simple work of removing the tensioner. I followd the instructions and was pleased with the performance of the tool.
positive,Purchased for a 2005 colorado.<br />Popped in easy use a little water for lubricant.. gas door shuts like new again
positive,"These are the good media, surely does well with filtering soot particulates and all. But it isn’t US made which is a bummer, so I’ll probably switch back to Baldwin."
positive,Good product
positive,Great company. Love these stickers. Thank you.
positive,Easy to install. Allows you to still use the garage door opener.
positive,"Worked great out with the old  and in with the new ,"
positive,"Works perfectly, very happy."
negative,"Perhaps a year and a half old.  Worked fine In 2022, but won't take a charge for 2023.  Purchased another brand from WALMART, and so far, works great.  No more GOO LOO."
positive,"Fits surprisingly well, it's definitely not going to be a summer jacket unless you live in the North. The inner line is just a vest, wish it had full sleeves, but hey you get what you pay for.<br />I swapped out the CE Armor as it's only CE Level 1 and I had level 2. That said they actually put a back pad in, it's not armor but if you have a back spasm from a previous accident and need to pull over to lay down it comes in useful"
positive,"Bought a pair of these to run on my derby car. Mounted on 15"" gm rims like a glove to a hand."
positive,Ok price
positive,works and fit well
negative,wired wrong
negative,Steel good
negative,Thought they were brighter but they enhance my car to a fairly decent look. Well I guess that's it...cant see the roads at all in the night. I was told the HID bulbs done/blow/dead
positive,"This fit our Oregon plate perfectly to prevent the tags from being blocked. I like how it is snarky, but not as well. Perfect for our RV."
positive,"Great item! My only issue was that while i was driving, i could barely hear the person speaking to me."
positive,Heavy duty cable works for marine use.
negative,"Not actually imprinted on the frame, more of a sticker.  However, Brotherhood products did a GREAT job handling the issue."
positive,I love this stuff!!  Works great and love that it's clear and holds great!
positive,I ONLY USE FOR MY CAR FOR DECORATIONS
negative,"Dnot buy this part, it will bolt up and looks identical to the original part, but won't work right. The calibration test will fail with a code in system, I had to remove it and buy a factory part for it to pass the calibration check and operate properly.. buyer beware"
positive,Well made
positive,I ordered this for a husband to use in our car. He has a similar item but it's a very basic low quality 1. It just plugs into the cigarette lighter outlet and only has a few different options and alerts. This 1 is far more advanced and much more high Tech and protect and literally has everything on it!<br /><br />It's super easy to set up but it's definitely got a learning curve when it comes to figuring out all the different functions and capabilities. There aren't very detailed instructions but you can look that up online that's what my husband did.<br /><br />He definitely still hasn't figured out how the different ways to use it and what all it does and how to do it lol but he knows how to use it to check some of the lights that pop up on the - and he did figure out how to disable the airbag deploy sensor which is very handy if you get into an accident and can't afford a mechanic lol I would say that feature alone makes this worth it in a great value for the money!<br /><br />This will work on a wide range of vehicles because we've tried it out in our early 2000 Lincoln car as well as his 2 thousandand 1 Chevy pickup truck and it worked fine for both. I would say as long as your vehicle has a computer in it this will probably work.<br /><br />Like I said still a lot to learn before he masters it and I have no idea how to use it but would definitely order again
negative,Works just fine.
positive,"Excellent bargain, I love it."
negative,"You get what you pay for. As noted by other reviewers, the outlet hose is flimsy and probably won't hold up to many uses. Also, I had to figure out how it went together as it did not include any instructions."
positive,Good quality product not sure the mileage I will get out of it. It did fit as Fram says but Amazon wasn't sure and they need to update it does.
positive,"incredible difference, absolutely the best lights i have ever had. Amazing increase in visibility and distance over any other light."
positive,"I needed to replace my severely hazed over lenses on my 06 Ram 2500.  I tried a few years ago to use one of the restore kits, that lasted only a few months.  It took less time to install these then the restore job.  Im extremely happy with these replacement light assemblies.  They fit exactly as the OEM'S...no issues. They even came with new lamps and sockets and didn't require any headlamp alignments.  No regrets."
positive,Great brush. Happy with it so far
negative,It's and okay sticker pack. Some stickers were blurry.
positive,"There are cheaper products that operate off a car battery only, via the cigerrette ligher. This unit has ac power so I can use it inside the house to pump up the inflatable guest bed.  Is it noisey? Sure, it is an electric motor in plastic housing sitting on a concrete driveway. Not a problem.  You don't think air supply vendors at gas stations are slowing down their compressors to increase profits? The last time I used a pay for air unit it billed my credit card $3.00 to partially fill two tires.  Now that I own the Kensun, never again.  I am old enough to remember when your tires were filled, oil checked and windshield was cleaned for 27 cents a gallon of fuel.  The unit is not super fast but steady and sure.  Tire pressure is key to safety and handling.  I live a mile up in the mountains and that altitude along with hot temps steals air pressure.<br /><br />On my van, the wheel covers make it very difficultt to screw the hose onto the tire valve stem.  I also purchased a Slime 20332 hose adapter which is the perfect size for the Kensun. It allows you to snap a tight connection to the Kensun hose. Nice storage case with various connectors and there is room for the Slime hose adapter. I am very pleased with this purchase."
negative,the scratches are still very visible!!!!!  waste of money.  this product didn't work on superficial scratches to door dings. i still have scratches
positive,This product works as advertised and easy to used.
negative,It’s just useless
positive,"Installed these on my snow blower.  No plastic parts, very sturdy and very bright."
positive,"Fast shipping, they look amazing!"
positive,VERY GOOD
positive,"It last for longer, great recent"
positive,"I have a 1998 Toyota, a wonderful car that I've owned since 1999. It is still running extremely well. It's never needed any major repairs, but because it is over 18 years old, some minor, plastic parts are starting to deteriorate, such as the plastic edging around the doors (which isn't worth fixing), and the door handles (which are definitely a hassle to deal with if you do not fix them).<br /><br />The first handle to break was on the driver's side a year ago. Fortunately for me, it happened while the car was in the shop for a routine oil change, and the management of the auto-repair shop where it happened very nicely took the blame and repaired it for free. Then over the last three months, all three of the remaining handles (I have the four-door model) broke. My natural choice would have been the nice auto-repair shop who did an excellent job fixing the first handle, but by then I had moved far away from them, and I had to find someone else.<br /><br />I contacted the local Toyota dealership, who quoted me $500 for parts and labor, as well as a local auto-repair shop that was highly recommended to me by a neighbor, who quoted me $300. Both seemed ridiculously high, and my husband and I started looking for alternatives. That led us to these handles right here on Amazon. Their price is massively lower than the dealership or the auto-repair shop led us to believe these parts would cost, and we bought them immediately.<br /><br />We then searched online for instructions for how to change the handles and found some great instructions with photo illustrations. If you search for &#34;Replace Interior Door Handle 1998-2002 Toyota Corola&#34; by wizgirl, you can find these outstanding instructions as well.<br /><br />The replacement job turned out to be incredibly easy to do. You only need a Phillips screwdriver and a pair of needle-nose pliers, which we had on hand in our home tool kit. My husband did the repair job, and it took him a measly ten minutes per handle, or a total of only thirty minutes to swap out all three. I would assume that it would take a qualified mechanic half that time.<br /><br />By any measure, then, even at $80/hour for a mechanic, the cost should have been quoted at a mere $50 at most to replace all three door handles, or 1/10th what the dealership quoted.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and do-it-yourself this job. There are many better ways to spend $250-450 than handing this job to a mechanic, who will very likely massively over-charge you."
negative,"I really, really wanted to like this. The knob was the perfect size for my hand. However, the finish was very scratched up upon opening the packaging."
positive,Fit well easy to install very nice
positive,This pump works for the power steering fluid drain. The hose can be adapted to the power steering canister hole using parts of the shampoo bottle pump. I took out the bronze adapter and have not used clips but the pump works just fine to start pumping the fluid (dexron III) out of container. I can see other uses for this pump in the household. Can't comment on the reliability but it worked for what I purchased it for.
positive,Perfectly fitted on my VW Golf's trunk. Package and items came in great condition.
positive,"Really nice looking and a great replacement for my banged up old Westin side steps.  These were easy to install since it was replacement, I just used the old brackets, but I think I could have easily installed them had I not had the old brackets."
positive,"Fast, easy, and efficient - I also appreciate the heavy-duty design and the value in basically getting TWO for the price of ONE when compared to other products of similar design and functionality.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for purchase - thank you!<br /><br />Dean H"
positive,Good value for the price
positive,"Only had it a couple months but works as described, no signs on wear yet."
negative,Way to freaking hard to put in or remove.
negative,Warning lights keeps coming up on the mini countryman
positive,Works great!!
positive,"This is a perfect cargo option for storing things that won't fit in your vehicle.  Great for carrying all your camping gear, going on vacation, put your luggage in there while traveling, so many great options.  Great capacity, will hold pretty much anything you could want to store in it.  Straps down easily and is durable.  Comes with a rain cover to help keep your stuff extra protected.  In my pictures that I am adding, there appear to be speckles on the cargo bag.  I assure you, there are no speckles.  The material is highly reflective and that's what's going on when my flash illuminates to take the picture.<br /><br />***I did not receive any financial compensation, simply the product free to me in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion***"
positive,Seems to be well made and was a perfect replacement for my buick's damaged remote. I had to take just a little off the printed circuit board where it was uneven from the factory. Snapped it together and viola!
positive,Fit perfectly- easy to install...
positive,Good quality.
positive,"The item is very fast and easy to use,so far is doing the job very well. I recommend this item to my friends."
positive,Arrived quickly<br />Fit well
positive,Very easy to go from small to large beverages in this holder. It is very sturdy stays in place.
negative,"the issue I had when I went to use them was that the pinch weld you slide them into wasn't even on both sides , so this causes the rubber to cock to one side and not stay flat  ill have to see if other vehicles are giving me the same issue"
negative,"This parking break actuator arrived on time. I had it installed by a professional mechanic. It worked for 10 days, then failed. I had it replaced, the same mechanic noticed that the quality of the part was not as good as other OEM parts for my BMW x5 and was certain that it would not last beyond 10 days again... ultimately, I had to return it for a refund."
positive,500 miles of use and cero 0 problems.<br />Good fit and quality parts.<br />Good purchase.
positive,"I picked this up to mount on my overland 4Runner.  I have lots of aftermarket lights and add-ons, If I let it sit too long, the battery goes dead.  I can't have that happening in the bush, so I'm going to mount this in between the battery and the truck to cut off power to prevent any little drain on the battery that might leave me stranded in the Backcountry.<br /><br />I picked a marine grade switch to help keep fine dust out of the mechanism. This one comes with slide out panels on all four sides for you to run your wires in and out (see pic)<br /><br />Specifications: continuous rating 275 amps DC,  intermediate rating 45 amps DC, cranking rating 1250 amps DC, voltage rating 12 to 48 volts DC terminal stud size 2x10 mm or 3/8, dimensions 69x69x75h mm, 10 plated copper studs and nuts."
positive,Great
negative,Low-sided on Jackie Robinson Parkway in NYC. Was going 30mph probably. I smashed into the side barriers in a curve. I had an ankle sprain.
positive,"Value for money: Absolutely, a strong 5/5. A bottle of this stuff will take you places, and last you for a long while. I've made the Carguys my official brand after trying and reviewing most of their products. Spend some extra coin on the equipment to clean your car.<br /><br />Scent is a medium 4/5. Whatever was in the air before this cleaner, is not purified; the smell that this product leaves is fresh/clean. As in, neutral odors have been removed, with a mild scent of this product to encourage a new smell.<br />easy to use: Read the instructions before maximum value for this product. If you are new and unfamiliar with Carguy brands, than you're gonna have a bad time. The product works, and works well at that, but not unless you read the instructions."
positive,Outstanding product very happy. Exactly what my Tundra needed. Rides and handles much better.
positive,Good
positive,"[EDIT 2021]  The chain didn't have enough cross-chains for me.  They were way too far apart, and not as shown in the description.  So I bought a second set, took them all apart and spaced them properly.  Now they work much better in wet snow.<br /><br />The tires on my Craftsman don't have very good lugs, as they are too close together.  Under certain wet snow conditions, they just pack up and lose traction.  These chains made a big difference, and I'm just going to use them all the time.  My sister has a larger Craftsman and the knobby tires look really aggressive."
positive,Well engineered easy to install
positive,Fit perfectly and easy to install
positive,Heavy duty.  I hope it lasts like it looks.
positive,"Works great , so far outlasting anything else i have tried ordering more , oh if you have black floor matts , they look new"
positive,This worked perfectly in my Forest River Sandpiper
positive,These are the exact same floor mats that came with my Chevy truck that I purchased new in 2009.  Very good quality and a perfect fit.
negative,"The kit came with a 49065-0724 oil filter not the one advertised. 40965-7010.<br /><br />The issue with the oil filter is even though it says it will fit the mule it will not fit your oil wrench. Plus it is smaller so less oil in a system already short of oil,"
positive,Fit perfect and door works like a new one
positive,"When I first saw these I thought they weren't needed. I actually thought they were silly. That was until the early morning sun beaming on my hungover face and a heat wave changed my mind. These are well worth the price and easy to install too. If you're trying to make you're camper more resistant to the outside temperatures, these are a must."
negative,"These bulbs are much more like a yellow than an orange.<br />They don't look right to me.<br />But it will pass inspection, so I'll worry about the color later."
positive,Worked great! Fel-Pro is top notch.
negative,There's nothing brighter or whiter about this bulb. Looks like a standard halogen and definitely dimmer that the stock bulb. Would not buy it again.
positive,Nice
positive,"Originally, the model i received did not work well.  i reported this to the seller and they sent me a different model. They didn't even ask for the original one back. The new one works quite well.<br /> We live in Manhattan, where car washes are a small fortune and inconveniently located.  The car vacuum allows me to clean the inside very effectively. So, in summary, the product is good and the seller stands behind their product"
positive,For our daughter that loves everything zombie she just had to have it in her Christmas stocking for Christmas morning and she wanted to put it on my Hummers back window<br /><br />BC
positive,"I have used this paste on four large tractor tires, it works well, the tub of paste will do many, many tires, the price is worth it IMO"
positive,Works as intended. Holds hoods and trunks up that have failed lift pistons. Doesn't fall off.
positive,Had this for about half a year now and I only leave it slightly opened for the scent to get out and it's still lasting this long. Nice fragrance and a small form factor that sits in the back of my car. Would recommend.
positive,"Put these in my E46 M3 and it looks perfect with my aftermarket halos. I went through a couple pairs of headlights now, these are the best for sure. It's a bright white color, not as blue as my last pair."
positive,Great deal!!! Fast shipping! Love these glasses! Very happy with my purchase. Highly recommend
positive,"Fits my Maserati QP 2014 . It took me 10 minutes to change and clean . Less than $40 vs $160 at the dealer , also you save a few hours by not having to go all the way there and wait for it  :)"
positive,I just got back from a 2000 mile trip and these highway bars are awesome and if you're looking and reading this review you better buy them because you'll love them too. Cost is high but well worth it.
positive,"Product as described, great price, liked free shipping."
negative,They look nice but they dont stick to interior door panels well :(
negative,Good light bulb replacement always lived up to the guarantee
positive,Great gauge for the cost. Very accurate.
positive,I dropped this in my 2002 Kawasaki Vulcan Nomad FI and it works perfectly.
positive,Love how it foams up because in my brain foaming=working. I used this soap and a drill brush set to clean my truck carpets and seats and it did the job. Old stains from the previous owner no longer exist.
negative,"Worked ok, one of the tracks i had to force to align with a hole in the middle. The front trim pieces are not 100% touching  the suv roof and there is no way i can  screw to the roof if there is no existing point from a factory.  It will work and hope it wont be worse later.<br />Customer service is horrible, will not work with a customer"
positive,Fitted easily and perfectly with my Toyota PRIUS 2005.
positive,worked great still hanging
positive,"I bought this mirror for my Honda Civic, I dont think there is a clip on mirror you can buy that will clear your visor on a civic, so I wasnt surprised when this one didn't.<br />This really isnt a problem for me, you can wiggle your mirror around it if you need to, but the convex mirrow works great, the moment I put it on I was impressed by the new level of visibility that I had behind me, I could even see out the rear door windows, Heck...you can just change lanes without lookin' back! no...though I dont recommend it.<br />I Literally installed it in 5 seconds, opens up some of your blinds spots, you can see more of whats going on in your backseat (for those with that kinda issue) and the design is sleek and gives life to your interior, sure...I recommend it."
positive,Great product at a great price.  So much cheaper than dealer and for the same product.  Perfect edition for tailgate where groceries may spill.  Makes any mess and clean up a snap.
positive,Great product
positive,"VERY WELL BUILT, EASY INSTALL"
positive,Good unit.
positive,Solid firm grip.  Hold up much better than standard rubber ones that are prone to deterioration if any contact with some chemicals occurs.  Things like bug spray etc.  They are about a 1/2 inch shorter than stock when installed on a grizzly.
positive,Works perfectly fine. Would purchase again.
positive,Just what I needed. Worked perfectly.
positive,"They look great! Bought them for my 2005 Honda Civic. Installed within 5 minutes. No need to worry about how many lugs your wheels have (4 or 5-lug) because these are universal. The 5-lug design is just for show, they look fantastic for the price!"
negative,"The first radiator I received had 44 cuts in the radiator from top to bottom, I received the box from USPS and the box was intact.  I opened the flap and removed the staples so that I would not accidentally damage the radiator upon removal, what do I find?  The first picture.  Looks like the box had multiple staples in it so probable was removed and replaced with the staples still in the box.<br />The second radiator is the second picture, abrasions but fortunately no leaks.  I installed the radiator and will fill the system and test it as soon as the garage temp gets above the 1 degree it is at right now.  My review will improve as soon as I am able to test it out."
positive,"adjustable, easy to install. Seemed to be made well. We were pulling a 2000 pound tear drop"
positive,used as a front vanity plate.
positive,"Foam seal shows through glass and required some shimming to fit just right, but they look good and light up bright."
positive,"Bought for my 2018 GMC Acadia.  I carefully compared this product to the same offering from WeatherTech, and this Husky liner is superior in how it handles the 3rd row seat belts.  With the WT product, the entire mat is narrowed for 1/2 of its length.  This means you don't have edge-to-edge coverage for the entire cargo floor area.  The Husky product here instead only has two 'notches' molded into the mat for the seat belts to run past."
positive,"My husband was looking for this particular part for his side window in his car.  He was pleasantly surprized to find it on Amazon and more surprized at the price.  Unfortunately, the part did not resolve his problem.  Not a problem with the part, A problem with the diagnosis.  It was received very quickly as promised and was a seamless process to return it as well.  Will definetly order auto parts thru Amazon again,"
positive,Works perfectly
positive,Keeps falling off my keychain. Small. Hopes it serve its purpose.
positive,Excellent product. Will def buy again. They are on top of their CS and make quality USA made products.
negative,"This product looks awesome, but under the surface it is made of cheap materials. Installing it I had to use quite a bit of force to get it tight enough and that was enough to break it.. I do not recommend it."
positive,Use with a good brake dust remover/wheel cleaner.  So EASY.  Takes the chore out of cleaning the wheels.
positive,"Ok for the home mechanic.  Not sturdy/ heavy duty enough for your everyday shade tree/stealership Mechanic.  I bought a few of these, only because they tend to break after many uses, but they are relatively cheap on amazon/ebay"
positive,"excellent quality, noiseless"
positive,If I purchased some of the fasteners locally They would have cost much more.
positive,"these mirrors are beautiful... the finish, the size, and just the look are so perfect.<br />and i wanna say thank you to pirate mfg for selling such a great product at a good price.<br />and i also wanna say thank you again for the special care that was giving in the preparation for such a safe shipping.<br />thanks so much..."
positive,fit my vehicle and enjoyed the cost
positive,Ignition on my pontoon boat.  Work great so far.
positive,"Well I sure was happy with my purchase , the assembly was easy, the product itself rock solid tough and everything I hoped it would be. I mounted it and pulled my Harley Davidson in and locked her in. It held nicely and enough space so that I can (if I so choose) to leave on kickstand when strapping it down . Not a option in many wheel chocks.  I bought three of these and should I sell my trailer will be buying these again. By far the best ones that I have seen even at all the bike rally events.<br /><br />Dave Steffen<br />Traditions Motorcycle Club"
positive,Matches 2002 jeep TJ perfectly
positive,works great now
negative,After using these for about 14 months (16000 miles) front end on my 2010 Versa began to shudder during braking. Will have to look for another brand.
positive,Perfect for protecting key fab that likes to come apart!
positive,This is the best cheese for your vehicles cracker
positive,"Easy to install, works great.  Great price - best on Amazon.  A good-looking, good quality part.  Please note that this trunk latch does not come with the ""control rod"" that goes from the truck-key hole mechanism to this trunk latch, but your old control rod is not really a ""wear part"", so you really don't need a new one -- our Camry with 220,000 mile on it ... the control rod could easily last for another 500,000 miles if the car could...  Some of the other more expensive trunk latches like this one comes with a new ""control rod"" ... don't spend the money for an un-needed ""control rod"", get this trunk latch ...!!!"
positive,"The short:<br />This connector worked perfect for my mercruiser gen 2 alpha out drive.<br /><br />A bit longer:<br />It was a perfect fit and my speedometer is working perfect now.<br /><br />This part is for the hose that connects from the inlet water track on your outdrive to the top port just below the connection of the outdrive to the stern. I posted two photos for reference for where it goes, and also one of it attached... and then a 4th of the general area.<br /><br />This shipped fast, fit perfect, and was a great price.<br />Definitely recommend."
positive,good
positive,Nice
positive,"This cover seemed a little too cheap for what it claimed to be so I took a chance ordering it. It came in a HUGE box, so I didn't know what I'd ordered at first.<br /><br />However, all skepticism disappeared when I installed or. First it does appear to be real leather. What's more, it does have the finger ridges you see in the picture. And best of all for someone driving a 2005 Excursion, it adds considerable thickness to the steering wheel.<br /><br />My standard install method is to put the cover in the oven for about 3 minutes at 150 degrees. It still takes some muscular thumbs to put it on, but the heat loosens things up enough to make possible.<br /><br />I've been super happy with the cover since the install. Winter hit, and the finger ridges are great for driving with gloves on. The thickness is perfect for my size L hands. It is tight on the steering wheel, and the leather color looks good in the Excursion.<br /><br />This was cheaper than the cheapo rubber and fabric type ones you find in stores, and three times as nice. If it lasts a couple of years, at least, this may be my best Amazon purchase in recent memory.<br /><br />Good purchase."
positive,love it
positive,works well and easy to hookup
negative,This wasn't the same as the original. The attachment method for the lock cylinder was different. I had to take it apart and swap the handle only instead of replacing the whole assembly. Turned out to be a  PITA
positive,Had to cut off the top mounting to remove old supports. It came with new ones. Went back together easily. Works great.<br />I had them on over a year when one side came off of the ball mount. I contacted the company to buy new replacement<br />upper ball mounts and the customer service was great. They sent me two new ones with no charge at all. Still working like new years later.
positive,I bought this for our 1982 Buick. It fits great and is very durable
positive,I really liked that spare parts were provided. That is a classy step
positive,The oil filter wrench is exactly what I needed since it supports both the standard one-piece oil filter as well as the Toyota oil canister housing. It's high quality aluminum and will no doubt last beyond the life of the car. Will definitely make changing oil easier.
positive,Works great. I like the bar under the ball which aids in towing and pulling. I'd buy again.
positive,this charger is exactly what i was looking for ...
positive,"Good features, fair suction, will do the job well."
positive,loved it
negative,Didn’t fit right.  Sent them back
positive,Fits a 2014 C300 4Matic perfectly. Less brake dust. Came with a sensor.
positive,"I love everything about this unit, compact, easy to use, great carrying case, however yet to use this yet, but we will see, so far this is great, would buy another one."
positive,Very good magnet! Even hangs on in the tractor
negative,Returned for refund.... Not what I expected... Looking for another type....
positive,Perfect size for wife's car.  The bags keep the debris contained.  Overall a good choice
positive,"nice product, thanks"
positive,"Installed power locks on my JK Jeep, used this to pry off plastic peices and other trim objects, worked perfectly only wish it included a window handle remover"
positive,Great stuff
positive,Fragile but nice details
positive,Fits like a glove. Easiest way to get it one is star from the top and inch your way down. Fits perfectly on my 2016 Merc Verado 250hp.
negative,"Headline says it is a headlight, but it is a foglight.  Whoever is entering this information should be reprimanded.  I had to go through the hassle of sending the item back.  I use Amazon to save time, and this purchase did not allow me to do that."
positive,Easy plug in install.
negative,"Although I am using this as an outboard stand, I am not specifically pleased with it's build. The stand is good enough for my use, but I wouldn't hang a 1200lb engine on it.....EVER! This review is written considering I am using the stand for an outboard engine that weights approximately 300 pounds, mounted directly on the mounting plate.<br /><br />Pros: The legs are sturdy, the bolt arms are sturdy, and the mounting plate is definitely thick enough for my application. The included hardware is decent, but not the best I've seen. The casters are good as well, no complaints there.<br /><br />Cons: There is absolutely no way you could mount a 1200 pound engine to this stand. Even with my 300 pound outboard mounted so the weight distribution is directly on the main post, the post leans considerably. When I say considerably, I mean about an inch (not feet like others have mentioned), but an inch can make a big difference. Using this stand to deconstruct and rebuild outboard engines has worked well, but there are times (specifically when the engine is fully assembled), that the stand feels flimsy, as if one wrong move could potentially snap the main post off. I have accepted this and have yet to have any major issues with the stand, but I closely monitor the welds and brackets to ensure a mess isn't made. Small to medium outboards, this will work very well. For large outboards or car engines, I wouldn't suggest purchasing this. It may handle some smaller tractor/ATV engines if a bracket was fabricated to accommodate them, but the weight of a full-sized v-6 or v-8 would just be too much."
positive,"Works ok, not 100% yet."
negative,"These bulbs are the right size and fit in the socket in place of the halogen bulbs. They were easy to install, though they do have a large external driver that hangs from a cable that you would need to secure under your hood. However, the real problem is that they do not tighten down well enough in the socket. I had them fully inserted and twisted to lock in place. One of them was pretty tight, and probably would have worked. The other was far too loose - the bulb would have shaken when I hit bumps, and I doubt it even formed a good water seal. I was using the correct gasket, though I tried the others just to make sure.<br />The light itself is fine, and suitable for high beams. However, I recommend trying a different brand to get a satisfactory fit. I replaced them with a different brand of LED and those fit perfectly."
positive,Installed on an 87 Jeep YJ. Be sure to use a little RTV where the gaskets meet. I used dental floss through a few bolt holes to secure the cork pieces to the pan as I lifted it into position. Then threaded a few bolts to hold the pan and then removed the floss.
positive,Great to use easy and understandable to catch on to how use it
positive,"This is a serious tire gauge.  I bought it for my mother in law as a gift for her new car, and although it may be slightly overkill, it works great and is pretty straight forward to use.  I would rather it be a bit too much than not enough.  I like actually that it's not a digital one (I'm always afraid with the digital faces that it's just one thing to break, or need to worry about getting a battery to keep working).<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend!"
negative,Truck tent was purchased for my husband's Christmas present.  I'll  update after he opens it.
negative,Worked perfectly for just under a year and failed. Now working to get warranty consideration.
positive,"Honestly, if you don't have a battery jumper in your car, truck, or vehicle, you need to get one and keep it in there because you will be happy. It is honestly the best decision I made to have one and keep one in my vehicle. First, this one stays charged for months at a time, so I don't have to worry about if it's going to work when I need it. I check it every few months to keep it up to date and all that good stuff. It's great to keep all your electronics charged too when you are traveling. I can jump my car off around 20 times on a single charge, which sounds crazy but that's pretty great and I hope I never have to do that. It's just a great thing to have with me and I don't have to worry about being stuck in the middle of nowhere and waiting for another car to come by to jump me off because I can do it myself. Such a great thing to have. Love it!"
negative,"Standard, a little flimsy. Would like it better if it was a little more sturdy."
negative,It looks good and all but the Jordan symbols are starting to disintegrate easily
positive,"I bought 2 of these on amazon.com and I love them. They are perfect for keeping your camper or tailor in place while you hitch up. I have them under my car on a slope because we had a damaged wheel. It had kept the car from rolling for over a week. For the price, you can’t beat the quality. I have a 34′ camper and this is why I purchase them. I would purchase again and again for any project of mine. They don’t slide!"
positive,works good
negative,This didn't last more than 2 cylinders. Stop holding pressure after 2nd cyl test.
negative,"The last few auto parts I ordered from Amazon appear to be returns or made of inferior quality.  This is to bad as the prices are good,  but I can't afford reworks.  Amazon needs to tighten up on the quality control of the suppliers they are selling."
positive,"Well designed and built!  It’s rare to find a product that even barely meets the minimum quality of production. Generally everything is so cheap and thin and prone to breakage. Not this. Solid design, easy to use, strong thick materials and a strong magnet. It feels like I got into a time machine back to when products were designed to last indefinitely. Buying more for every car (I actually bought this one to be a red nose for my Rudolph the Reindeer on my 1958 BMW Isetta)."
positive,"So far only used black, worked as adv on my CP 7201. What I really like is the pad to backing pad is recessed and no chance of an accidental burn or problem with backing pad catching an edge, curve etc."
positive,can adjust exactly how you like
negative,It's what you expect.
positive,Fit perfect
positive,"These towelette are smaller than the original towelettes.  However, they do a great job of cleaning and treating my windshield."
positive,"Hands down the best tire gauge I've ever owned. Why the gauge is upside down on the hose I don't understand, but it's not an issue with the swiveling hose connector that comes pre-assembled with the gauge and is ready to use right out of the box.<br /><br />Easy 5 stars from me. Buy it! You won't be disappointed."
positive,Top grade ball and mount. Comes with the pin and clip stuffed inside the square tube. Class 3 hitch is good to 6000 lbs. Your vehicle may be rated for less.
positive,Really good tool for DIY'er looking to check the brake lights on the back of a vehicle without having an assistant.
positive,Great ride. Happy so far. 2011 Audi Q7. Thicker sidewalls means better Road feel. I like it.
positive,"Good fit and feel. Touch screen feature is nice, but not as accurate as just a finger.  Great glove though."
negative,Not a bad price but the color rubs off everytime you have to wrench these on or off.
negative,"Installed personally onto my 2001 Chevy Malibu and the instructions to install are void of any real tangible explanation on how to do it.  Spiders website was just as lackluster.  After 2 months of trial and error, I finally got them to work correctly.  After having these installed for roughly 2 years, my only real gripe outside of the installation peice is that the bulbs have a tendency to go out frequently, which is expensive."
positive,Just what I needed
positive,"Bought and installed to replace an incandescent version of the RV outside light.  It was a good price BUT when installing there is no ""backplate"" to mount on (unlike the one I had).  The holes did not exactly line up and I had to get #6 1 inch screws with anchors to complete the job. Lights up bright though!"
positive,as described fast shipping
positive,"Easy to use, quick fill on low tire. Light weight and thin design."
positive,Worked well for wiring small led light bar on a 20 AMP fuse. Was easy to solder. Sheathing on wire looks to be good as well. Lots of cable although I didn't use for trailer but I used it on a small tractor.
positive,"I bought this item for my step son for Christmas and my husband was bummed cause this one is better than the one he has!  Fortunately this woman knows her husband well enough and the tools he uses, so I bought 2 so he can have his own.  He just has to wait for Christmas to find that out  :)"
positive,"I took a job as a buyer for a Dealership over a year ago and the Cruise Control never worked.  It's an 80 Mile roundtrip 5 days a week, plus a lot more on trips to auctions. I bought a TDI with 270k on it, and have driven it 35K without cruise ever working, so I bought this for under $40, had my shop install it for an hours labor of $45 and I got my cruise again for under $100. Works perfectly. Now the cheeeeep bastige that I am is hoping for an increase to pay for the new switch and repair. I figure my 41 mpg avg ought to go up to about 43 with the new part??  LOL."
positive,Fits a little loose.  Broke one trying to tighten it.  Gorilla glue fixed it.  Still loose and wobbly.
positive,"I am glad I purchased this for my Mitsubishi eclipse cross 2022. It was a perfect fit. It made my car look way better. Plus, it makes for an easy clean up when my daughters spill their drinks."
negative,"Bought these to help organize the paperwork in my glove box.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- My registration and insurance cards fit really nicely in the slips<br />- Makes it easy to find your paperwork in the glove box.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- They are a little flimsy; I can definitely bend them. I would have liked them to be make out of a stronger cardboard.<br />- In he heat, the ink from my insurance card came off onto the plastic (this happened on one of the two that I bought)<br /><br />If there was a better quality version of this out there, I would definitely trade up."
positive,"Finally, they came out for the 2018 JL.  and they fit."
positive,Really quiets the ride with the roof open<br /><br /> even at highway speeds !!
positive,"Works Great, Nice fit, Easy on / off"
positive,Nice for the price
positive,As far as I can tell this item works as advertised. You could pay more. But the increase in quality or performance would be marginal from my comparisons.
positive,"These running boards installed easily but they do not come with instructions. They fit perfectly and required no modification on my 2012 ML350. They seem strong but only time will tell.<br /><br />One note, these are not made of aluminum. They are 100% molded plastic. Not a single bit of aluminum on these anywhere. I deducted 1 star for the false advertising.<br /><br />11/23/22 Update: I have had rhese on my vehicle since the original review and they are still working fine. A little worn where the aluminum paint wore off but functionally fine."
positive,"Bought this for the 2nd differential fluid change. The diff had been noisy and I thought a bearing might have failed. I changed to this fluid, the noise was immediately gone.<br /><br />Quality product."
positive,"arrived on time, nice price"
positive,"high quality brake pads; these pads are working very well; no squeal; little, if any, brake dust.  When the time comes to replace the front pads, I will be buying these again."
positive,Looks great on my car.
negative,"Worked good for one day, next time I went to start the truck, made some weird noises, had to try it a couple times, and finally got it started.  Certain to fail soon.  Wish I would have paid for a better quality starter."
positive,They look great and do what they're meant to do on my motorcycle. What more can I say other than the word count requirement on these reviews is lame...lol.
positive,I will update this if anything changes. I have 2nd row bucket seats. My dog is 27 lbs and this doesn’t bow between the seats or anything. It was really easy to put in the car and the dog seems to like it. I didn’t even have to scoot the second row seats back or the front seats forward to get it to fit. The head rest straps were perfectly aligned. 2021 explorer limited hybrid.
positive,Was a great gift for that blingy person.
negative,Was not good for me may be a great product. I just threw away.
positive,great quality product
positive,It was piece of cake replacing the cable about six months ago.  I bought Lisle torx bit with it and all went well on installation.  Saved a lot of money by doing it myself and not paying dealer.
positive,Great selection
negative,Most in the pack come with loose parts on the inside which can cause all sorts of problems. I can see maybe 1 not made right but almost all of them rattled with loose filter and gasket.
positive,"Fast shipping, product is as described and matched my 2015 Thor motor coach drawer push catch-latch-grabbers perfectly. Recommend this<br />product."
negative,It doesn’t form like the one showing in the video.  I can’t get this out of the box or off my hand.  Don’t think I can use it to clean anything.
positive,My wife had to sew this so that the straps were attached as the 2nd time I wore them they came unstitched.  Otherwise a good product for protecting my boots.
negative,Frustrating didn't work out of the box..
positive,"This looks really great on my car, but my only complaint is it got bent one time thru the carwash, but it was pretty easy to push back."
positive,Good cabin filter for my CX-9
positive,Fit and working good
positive,Strong bond but doesn’t “weld” the pieces together. Not sure if it’s any stronger than construction adhesive that you’d buy at a box store.
positive,"My hood struts seem to die every 5 or 6 years.  I've been buying the Stabilus struts as replacements.  They work okay and seem to last as long as the OEM struts did.  I have no idea if 5 or 6 years is the right amount of time, but for what these cost it's not horrible.  These are really easy to install.  The old struts pop out and the new ones pop in place.  Takes less than 5 minutes to swap.  I'll continue buying these."
positive,Fit my 1976 Winnebago just fine.
positive,Very nicely made good and sturdy. And as my state issues 2 plates it's nice it came as 2 pack.
positive,FITS LIKE A GLOVE!!! i have been without a cup holder divider for a few years now. i finally decided to get a new one and OMG life changing. so nice to have a legitimate cup holder in the front console. I have a 2003 toyota highlander.
positive,"a great tool, especially for arthritic hands."
positive,Amazing product. Always quiets my engine even more than it already is and keeps my oil looking spot on! Definitely keeps oil from breaking down over time and lubricates the engine to the max.
positive,Hvnt used yet but if it comes from same manufacture as the wax I’m sure it’s of great quality.
positive,not a simple change out had to use my beat up old thinking cap
positive,"Fantastic, I have it on my golf cart and it works perfect"
positive,What can you expect from an original product? simply excellent.
positive,"Purchased from Beiter DC Power. They were the real thing, by PowerSonic.<br /><br />Drop in replacements for 1270/1280/1290 series batteries, with more power than the 1270/1280 series. (So I don't know why anyone would buy the 1270/1280 anymore, except that the 1270 is sometimes significantly less expensive.)<br />The batteries I received were fresh (less than 3 months old) and in good condition."
positive,It does what it's designed to do...keep sweat from running down into eyes.<br /><br />Pros: The wicking material is more than adequate and quality is very good.<br /><br />Cons: Some may find the wicking material headband a bit too thick.  This may cause your cap to fit too snug and be too tight.<br /><br />I also have the Under Armor skull cap which is lighter weight and will use this if too tight but does not wick sweat as well.
negative,These are the worst tires I have ever purchased and I would never buy them again. They have blown out on regular pot holes 3 times. Completely ridiculous. I beseech you not to ever buy these tires. They are the worst.
positive,i have to use it every other day and it still runs strong
positive,Works very well for its expected requirements.  Recommended purchase.
positive,Good stuff - works as advertised
positive,Fell off within 2 hours. Lol. But it was great while it lasted. :) (car was clean before applying)
positive,The instruction didn't say to install on starboard side. I installed the first time on the port side and discovered that I could not rotate it far enough. works fine on starboard side though.
positive,arrived and installed as stated
positive,Good parts and the clutch works great again.
positive,Works great best price very happy
negative,"installed the complete kit....after about 15,000 miles.....well...here I am again...looking for a better quality belt this time....I already have it apart and all the seals are good...no issues with the tensioner or water pump....the belt almost made a clean break...fun....."
positive,As expected
negative,"Look good in the box but I could never get them to fit. I tried everything read in the reviews. I.e. orientation of the small to large end, correct numbered insert to the correct position on gril..<br />I ended up with some scratches to my grill trying to insert😡"
positive,Excellent
negative,I was expecting a led light for my Tacoma that was white and then turned yellow when activated. This was not those.
positive,these is a good price for the lenght
positive,"le quedo un poco pequeno a mi tacoma, no trajo el alambre que se ilustra, lo demas bien"
positive,Great fit as advertised
positive,Appear to be very sturdy. They weigh about 12 pounds each. We have not yet installed them on our RV.
positive,"Decent price, good thing to have, sits in trunk, haven’t had to use, will write review when I finally use!"
positive,Used to replace pulley on power steering pump for my 2005 Dodge Stratus. Used with small impact - worked great.
positive,Other than a few plastic burrs that needed rounded off. This product is just as good as the OEM and the lenses are brilliantly clean and clear.  Plastic brackets are not brittle either.
positive,Very nice old school touch.<br />Glass and metal as it shoud be.<br />:-)
positive,I purchased a few of these “tech friendly” gloves from other sellers only to find that they either worked or barely worked.  These live up to the claim “tech friendly!”  Plus they are durable and warm!
positive,"Perfect , precise fit for my 2002 Acura TL rear brake rotor. The finish is nicely machined and the performance great."
positive,Does the job
positive,Great
positive,"For how cheap these are I really didn’t expect them to work well, really just wanted something on my bike to make sure I didn’t get pulled over for not having mirrors. But they actually work great. They went on in about 5 minutes and don’t vibrate at all while riding. Definitely a good buy for the money"
positive,These were great! Easy to install and holding up nicely. Will definitely purchase again.
positive,My kids room went from bright to dark with this easy thing! Just slide it in and bam! Great item!
positive,Needed for my daughters toddler bike and the ones stollen off my car. Worked great for both!
positive,This tach works great! it's inexpensive and isn't obnoxiously huge. I've had it installed in my car for a year and it works just as good as the day I bought it.
positive,"package showed up promply. I have used inferior products that have blown fuses in my truck but this one is great. has two options for set-up, either clips for direct battery hook up or cigarette lighter. had it ready to go and hooked up in less than 5 minutes. small & portable very reliable. great product!"
negative,As you can see in my picture of key the craftsmanship of the product is extremely poor. The key totally lacks a mirror cutting. I am expecting the key to jam and break within days of installation.
positive,"As you see my wheels where filthy from months of brake dust, i decides not to dilute this product and give it a try, this thing works , this was with no scrubbing and just a pressure washer ! I am surpised finally a wheel cleaner that works !hell yeah"
positive,They look good and so far holding up well.
positive,Great product thanks!
positive,"Well made,no flaws,fit perfectly and a great price."
positive,replaced my old one with this one and no problems installing or leakes yet good heavy duty metal and was original part
negative,Did not fit the truck it was ordered for. Was no where near what was described. Returned.
negative,"Brake pads work well and are quiet, but the dust is unreal. I have to clean my rims weekly to keep them from turning completely black. I would find another brand if I was to replace my brakes again."
positive,This stuff took an amazing amount of brake dust off my rims and wheels which cut down the time I had to spend washing them. It does smell terrible but it dissipates quickly. Buy the larger size because you’ll go through it quickly when you see how much junk it gets off without any elbow grease.
positive,They look great.  Installed on an 03 Chev 2500hd.  Matched with Firestone air bags and A Big Wig Sway bar from Hellwig.<br /><br />Big difference on the ride.<br /><br />Forget the Rancho’s.  Get the Bilstien’s.<br /><br />Do it!
positive,Fit and works perfectly. Very easy to install.
positive,"fit perfectly, easy install, good directions."
positive,Worked perfectly for putting in my valve cover on my lt1. Anything that keeps oil out of my intake is great!
positive,Easy installation. Fit my 2000 Mitsubishi Galant VR-4 perfectly.
positive,"Love  the look!!!!! These tires are awsome! My son drove the truck from California to Austin Texas he was stationed in Forthood, fully loaded with his belongings and had to replace the tires when he arrived lol ,, these are not highway tires! But they got replaced with the exact same ones! They look so dang nice....."
negative,"Perhaps it was because I used it on a blowup bed. But it didn’t stick at all very well. I finally used a different adhesive to glue it down. After taping that down, my bed stayed inflated."
positive,Really nice install on my 2015 Roadmaster
positive,Nice connector. Good quality
positive,Suit is lightweight and effective. Good value for the price.
negative,Really didn't work for me. It wouldn't stay in the outlet in car when trying to vacuum and to  wide for smaller areas.
positive,"This is a beautiful sticker. In fact, this is the second time I've purchased it and I bought enough to give to friends that admired mine.<br /><br />Excellent quality, you will be happy with it."
negative,"looks nice, but very cheap. popped and cracked and broke during install. there is no adjusting these either. dont waste your money"
negative,"Good quality, missing items, poor customer service"
positive,I can't wait to use it!
negative,Did not fit as expected. Disappointed after much manipulation there are still ripples on the rear towards both sides. Going to have to carefully cut slits to smooth it out losing some of the protection I wanted. Can’t believe this was lasered for a Porsche macan. K
positive,inexpensive and a good fit
positive,Purchased these helmets for 2 of our grandsons who are 4 & 5.  Size S fits fine.  My problem with the whole order was that they were left at my front door while it was raining hard. Why can't amazon put a plastic bag around items like UPS & Fed Ex do?  We had to remove the pads from one helmet & put each piece in the dryer along with the dust cover.  Very annoying to say the least.  The helmet was a good deal & seems to be great quality.
positive,Works great as a side mount on my camper. Strong and well made. Just make sure you bolt it on with sufficient bolts that will handle the weight of the tank when driving on the road. I used a carriage bolt on the top hole and bolted it all the way through the camper wall with a nut and washer on the inside. I also drilled an extra mounting hole as an added precaution. So far it hasn't budged. Very satisfied.
positive,Well made valve stem
positive,"I received the lights very quickly. One bulb was not working, I contacted the company and got a quick friendly response. They sent two replacements without delay. They told me that the clocking of the high beams would not be a problem, if I had trouble to contact them again. They were correct, no pattern issues. I have been using them for a couple weeks so time will tell on reliability."
positive,"It does the job, no more paper towel rolling around on the floor"
positive,"Good quality license plate frame, logo is not too big or flashy, good quality metal."
positive,I ordered this brush specifically because the ice scraper is not part of the brush end. Now I can brush around my rear view mirrors and spoiler bar without the ice scraper getting in the way or scraping my car. The handle is long enough that I can brush half of my windshield without leaning against the car. And it's pink.
positive,Works fine.
positive,Hopefully I can find someone to help me get this on my new car. I have arthitis in my hands and I am hoping this and griping type gloves will help.
positive,Good deal and it fit the vehicle perfectly.
positive,"Fits perfect, much cheaper than EOM."
negative,"I bought this early on in my ownership of our vehicle, that way I have something ready when it’s time to change the filter. Fast forward to today, I found out it does not fit our vehicle since there’s a divider in between the compartment, and this doesn’t have the space for it. So if you have a 5th gen RAV4, this will definitely not work. Too bad I can’t send it back for a refund since it’s been so long."
positive,"Such a small package, but a real goliath in strength and battery life. Yes it will air up those tires. Assorted settings for what you're airing up. You can preset the air pressure. Will hold a charge for several uses. Has usb ports to charge devices when not airing up tires. Great value for your money."
positive,This is a fantastic product for the cost. Added it on my 2007 FJ Cruiser to add to other lights for emergency response. Works and looks great with the Amber LED retrofits that I installed.
negative,Cheap made in Taiwan. Adjustment ball and socket popped out while trying to adjust up and down. I wished I would have spent the extra money and bought genuine OEM from a dealership. You get what you pay for. Ground some plastic off the back and made it work. Took about 2 hrs to make it adjustable and function properly. Junk.
positive,"Easy install, very bright…"
positive,"This works great and is easy to set up.  Stops our 21 ft. travel trailer smoothly and makes for a safer tow experience.  I would have given it 5 stars but the description stated it would work with my ram truck but what it does not tell you is that, unless you know how to bare wire this to you existing wire harness, an adapter is need to allow you to plug and go.<br /><br />After calling several local parts stores to try to find an adapter, we finally went back on line to do a search since we could not find an adapter locally and the cost of having it professionally installed was more than the brake itself.  We did find on online that worked and allowed for an easy installation finally!<br /><br />Word of caution, unless you can bare wire, get an adaptor to go with this."
positive,Cables need lube. This let's you quickly and cleanly lube them. Ingenious! I recommend using Dupont Teflon motorcycle chain lube to lube inside those cables. Super smooth operation now!
positive,No directions and one bolt was bent.
positive,"This is by far the brightest single light source I have ever seen in my life.  I installed it onto a bull bar in front of my truck and found it to be many multiples brighter than my headlights.  When this light is on, you can't tell any difference by turning on/off the regular headlights/hi-beams because they are nothing in comparison to this.  I have actually been a bit shocked to find out that it is barely too bright to be practical.  I find that when I use this late at night on the highway, there are very bright reflections from mile markers and especially exit signs.  This light is really intense and I love it."
negative,"I got these about 10 years ago so I'm here because I need a new pair because the elastic is all stretched out.  I really like these pads with two exceptions.  They are comfortable to wear, don't slide down, and not too warm like most other hard shell pads.  And they are super easy to put on and take off.  Very early on I discovered that they rubbed my knees raw when pedaling so I stopped using them except for big mountain days. Except that they don't have that much padding. I solved both those issues when I got G-Form knee pads. I wear the G-forms on every XC ride and wear the Launch pads over them on big mountain days and super techy trails. Awesome combo."
negative,"I ordered this because i needed the 67 by 28 in sun screen. what i got instead was 66 by 27, it LIED TO ME. DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU EXPECTED THE 28 in one. This is a clear MISINFORMATION OF WHAT IS BEING ADVERTISED."
positive,Works as intended would buy again
positive,Very well done design.
positive,"I ordered this kit as an after Christmas present for my brother, who is always driving around the countryside. I just went to Walmart and they had the same kit for nearly 1/2 of the price here. It was $35 at Walmart. This is a 5 star kit being reduced to 4 stars over the price."
positive,NEEDED A LONGER HOSE FOR GREASE GUN ...
positive,"This tire carrier is designed so simply, yet so intelligently, I feel compelled to give it a five star rating. It offers one great advantage over standard tire carriers; it hugs the boat trailer much more closely and this makes parking and jockeying the boat into my garage far easier. More than once, my previous tire carrier caught on my garage door frame because it stuck out too far from the boat trailer.<br /><br />One reviewer wisely suggested shortening the length of the two threaded ends to avoid being snagged when walking by--I cut 2 1/4 inches off and it makes a significant difference. I do wish the carrier had come with more specific instructions--it actually installs far more easily than I initially thought. Here's a tip...you do not  need to buy bolts to snug it up. The lock holders actually do the job of snugging up the tire to the trailer frame."
positive,"This coil was an exact replacement part and much cheaper than all of the other coils I looked at! For my money, I will order from this company again!!"
positive,Worked great for sway bar end links on a 4runner
negative,It's not working
positive,Expected them to be darker however we really like the look of these.
positive,"I thought these might be knock-offs, but they look and work just like the cables that came with the charger."
positive,"I bought the same kit from the local parts store. It was more expensive there due to the state fee. Just wanted to share my experience.<br /><br />The can of AC Pro restored my AC to full functionality and I do not have an issue with the product itself. It is easy to use and works well. However I have an issue with instructions and videos from the AC Pro company.<br />I connected the gauge to the car without the can and with the engine and AC off, to measure the  static pressure. It showed somewhere in the yellow zone, around 75PSI. Then I turned the engine and the AC on to measure low pressure. It showed in the beginning of the green zone, somewhere around 30PSI. The instructions said that the pressure in the green zone indicates that the AC has charge. But my AC did not blow the cold air at all.<br /><br />After much research on the internet, I decided to go ahead and refill the the AC. Instead of following instructions on the can, I just measured the air temperature at the vents as I was refilling the refrigerant. I also consulted the chart from Autozone website on the AC refrigerant pressure at different temperatures. The vent temperature started to drop soon after the pressure in the system was going a little bit up. The temperature dropped for a while and then started to come up when the pressure got to around 40PSI. I would say it took more than a half of the can. At this point I stopped charging.<br /><br />So your AC may be low on refrigerant even if the hand is in the green zone. It takes a while to charge the system and if you are careful, you will not overcharge. Just hold the trigger for 5 second, checking  the pressure after 10 or 15 seconds. After the pressure increases a bit, check the vent air temperature. Stop charging after the temperature starts to increase or the pressure is in the indicated range from the table.<br /><br />Over all I am very happy with the product. It got my AC working again for probably half the price of the repair shop. I would recommend this and would buy this again. Just wish that the instructions were a bit more detailed."
positive,"I'm picky about wipers.  I expect: quiet operation, smooth glide, long life, and of course a clear view without streaks.  These are better than most in every respect, and I have tried many brands.  I have also found that the old fashioned framed wipers like these seem to do better than the frameless in some applications.<br /><br />Update 2/21/14:  Follow up to my original review.  These are still working for me and I've had them on the car for a year now!  Still quiet and a good clean wipe.  At this point I think they are just as good if not better than any other 'framed' blade I have tried.  They also still look good, we live in the north and the salt can severe temperature swings can sometimes make a blade start chipping/rusting but these are holding up.  Great value!<br /><br />Update 8/27/14:  I finally had to replace these wipers.  They never got noisy, but started leaving streaks.  Very happy with the quality and longevity and replaced them with the same product."
positive,Love these bulbs just ordered on a Friday night & next thing I know I got them on Monday 4/5 days sooner then the expected date. Now I brag to all my friends on how much I love them.. I replaced all my interior lights (2000 Pontiac Montana) with these... One thing is that there a little bigger then the other bulbs but we'll worth the money and time of installing them.... Don't think twice.... You will be happy you didn't....
positive,Quick and easy install on a 2013 Cruze. Comes with everything.
positive,"Perfect fit for your bumper on your RV, these caps will allow air to get in to dry out any moisture. That means there is less chance of rust from the inside out.<br /><br />I put the poop/pee/water discharge hose in my bumper, so I want that sucker to dry out. These caps are easy to remove, but they won't let bugs get in there to enjoy the remnants left in your hose (yummy).<br /><br />Buy these with confidence."
negative,"I used this jack 2 times. It broke on second use. During first use on a 350 z the jack was leaning a little. Then I used the the jack to lift the passenger front side of a ""Toyota solara 2 door sedan to replace the axle. This is not a really heavy car and the Jack was only holding the left front side up. Well after a few hours the jacks foundation folded and bent dropping the car. Thank god I had put the tire under the front of the car. We had been working under the car a few minutes before the jack self destructed. They show this jack as rated for 5K lb ? No way it could not even hold 1000 lb. Do not buy and you already own this do not trust it to hold anything safely."
positive,"Awesome cover for the price, high quality and fits perfectly. Easy to put on and take off. Appears to be leak proof as well. Would highly recommend!"
positive,Fits perfect!
positive,Fit perfectly
positive,Excellent product. I was able to thoroughly bleed my coolant system with this funnel.
positive,"I wanted to see if this worked well with partially discharged (weak) batteries and indeed it does.  Even not using fresh batteries, the light seemed nice and bright and should be noticed from some distance.  With the less than fresh batteries, it tells me this would continue to work until the batteries were quite low.  That's important if you car gets stranded, if using it in your car (which is probably the best use of this item).  It has a nice strong magnet on the bottom to easily adhere to the top of your car or any metal that magnets work on.  Batteries were so easy to change.  The bottom unscrews to reveal the battery compartment.  It appears to be reasonably well made; not made of cheap, thin plastic that will break soon.  Although it appears to be mostly plastic, it is good quality.  Well worth the price for your safety.  I can't find anything to criticize with this item.  It is simple, well made and it works!  Has on/off switch and 2 different strobe patterns."
positive,"look good, bought one for each car"
positive,"Bought this for my Ecoboost F-150 and 20ft aluminum car hauler. I do a lot of towing and this has been a solid performer. Load bars eliminate just about all bounce... even with ~1,500lbs of payload plus a towed vehicle. Highly recommend this setup. And at Amazon's price, it was $500 cheaper than my local store!"
negative,Did not work. Could not use do not have a working key garb. So I could not get it programmed
positive,We bought a code reader from Amazon for $100. It told us which wheel the sensor was out on. We replaced it with this one. We used the code reader to reset the car computer and clear the warning lights on the dashboard. We spent $135 instead of $500 at the dealer.
negative,It didn't work. Before trying to fix it yourself contact dealership it's a recall and will replace for free.
positive,Exact fit. Good price.
positive,Got these replacements just in time for the rainy season and they work like a charm. At first one streaked and squealed but that long since passed and they fit and work just as well as the OEM versions we had on previously.
positive,This thing fit like a glove!  Bright white!  Looks great.<br /><br />Very easy to install!<br /><br />Not too sure what else you can say about it...  As long as it is the correct size for your RV.... I'd recommend this one.<br /><br />You get the handle and the slide panel in one package.
positive,"They were spot on right, but not required"
positive,Works great in my old 60's car with a generator and no alternator to ensure that the car produces enough current to keep the battery charged. Easy display and bonus on the USB charger for the phone
positive,"Is a really good easy to use product. I get it because I had to make a work in my van, replacing radiator, and this helped me a lot. Make easier all the bleed process."
negative,I have changed my review to 1 star because after only a few months one of the wires snapped inside and is now sticking out of the side. It is shard and will scratch anything it touches...COMPLETE TRASH!
positive,Simple design that works. The sliding extra dark section is a bit awkward but driving towards the sun in a small sedan it is also useful.
negative,"The little plastic clip that holds the adapter on popped right off when I clicked it in. The spring pressure should hold it on the car, but that is a poor design for it to break like that."
positive,"Arrived right on time! It came while I was in the middle of doing the Spring service on my riding mower which had a flat at the time, timing couldn't have been better. Worked great."
positive,Works perfectly with my lexus.
positive,Fit perfectly
negative,"The suction just wasn't enough to clean my truck. If it weren't for the brush attachment, it wouldn't have cleaned anything."
positive,good
positive,Good useful tool well worth the price.
positive,"My husband I purchased this product for kayaks and luggage.  It worked great, install was a breeze.  The only drawback was one incorrect part was sent in our kit.  (The rubber foot that you see in the photo actually, they are cut to fit a certain side of the car, and our back passenger was wrong)  My husband and I attempted to install anyways because we had to be on the road and couldn’t really wait for a replacement piece.  The rubber molded itself and the system still worked perfectly. (note* we have a Mazda CX-7 with grooves in the hood where this will fit, which is why I feel that even though the rubber piece was wrong, the groves were able to allow it work.  If you don’t have the grooves I would return the piece.)  I would defiantly recommend this product!"
negative,"got wrong sizes,,,,"
negative,"Bought the Power Stop KOE15265DK for my 2000 Ford Ranger. Hardware and shoes were great. The drums were a huge headache. Both were out of round badly and I had to have them turned, {$40 for the pair.}<br />You'd thing that would've covered it, but no. The centers were too small for the hubs. Had to grind it out with a dremel until it was nearly an eighth of an inch wider.<br />After all that, it seems that all is well. Likely won't be coming back."
positive,Tricky to install because of the adhesive .Don’t pressure it until all on and fitted.
negative,Not a long lasting tire. Wear quickly
positive,Good solid device.  Arrived on schedule.  Works fine.
positive,Would have loved if it came in gloss black to match the stock front highway bars but for the  price am happy. Its well built and fits perfectly
positive,"As advertised. We'll made, holds shape, expands nicely. Expect the size to be as stated. Very handy for convenience items. This is not a larger oversized travel bag, which is exactly what I wanted."
positive,Did its job.  Allowed my vehicle emblem to adhere and it is never coming off of the car!  Everyone should use this stuff.
positive,"I have and will continue to buy Husky Liners for every vehicle I'm expected to take care of.  They aren't cheap, but they are worth every penny spent on them.  Particularly if the vehicle lives in wintery climes."
positive,"Very handy stickers for the DMC cotton threads.  Only thing is the numbers do not include any of the 4000 and up colors, but useful for thread organization."
positive,"Bought this for my Euhomy Car Fridge/Freezer.<br />Pros: Faster Charging off of wall outlet.  Unknown on solar as I haven't tried it out yet.<br />Cons:  I was looking for a longer discharge time.  I ran my Euhomy on Econ mode and this lasted about 6 hours.  Not bad, but not great.  Pricing - a little expensive but I'm more annoyed that myEuhomy didn't come with a battery included."
positive,Easy to put over damaged glass.
positive,"Nice looking keychain, well made"
positive,I was not shocked at how well this stuff worked.
positive,"unfortunately, item is too big to accommodate my snowblower tires"
positive,"I started using wrench off K&N filters years ago when I saw that I could get them for basically half the price on Amazon as if I went to a parts store. Before I bought any, I read comments about how they would leak or the seal would bust etc. but I also read so many positive reviews that I decided to try them out myself. I now have my whole family and my boyfriend exclusively using these filters. The key is that they are very specific in their title. They are wrench OFF not on. You still only need to hand tighten these or they will leak because the nut at the top will be compromised.<br /><br />K&N filters are also great to use for harder to reach areas. We definitely learned this with my first car where the filter was up on the front of the engine, but the car was so compact that trying to get the filter from the top or the bottom was a feat. Buying K&N made my dad’s job 100x easier when he could just put a wrench up there and get it off with ease. I will probably never switch to another brand."
positive,worked as described.
negative,Did not for what they said it would
negative,It really is not very useful. I thought with the longer handle it would be helpful but it is just awkward. The scraper isn’t very big so you have to scrap a lot.
positive,So idk Nissan headlights have small bowls that the bulb that the light fits into so it has that working against it!! With that in mind I should have got a little bit brighter LED for it. It’ll the HD 11 will have to work for now till I can upgrade again?
positive,"Assembled it yesterday without the benefit of the instructions that got hidden when I unpacked it.  Seems to be sturdy enough, once assembled I put it into the receiver of my motor home and sat in it.  I have a couple of minor niggles, the bolts that assemble it are different sizes, although they supply flimsy wrenches, I had difficulty find the right ones in my tool box.  Secondly where the two sides of the basket meet there is a small gap, very small admittedly but I can see rain and/or road spray getting into the rails of the basket.  I have taped them with black Gorilla tape to keep the weather out.  I think it will work out fine I will be transporting the portable generator for my motorhome on it."
positive,"Change the written description to match the product.<br />This is NOT a “Wheel Bearing Race”, it is a 32” Kargo Master Shelf Unit."
positive,"It's a Moog, enough said. Fits my 06 civic awesome and is way more robust than stock. You won't regret this purchase."
positive,I'm pleased with purchase from this seller I'll make more purchases from this seller in the future.
positive,Easy to install and takes the rattle out of a loose receiver hitch.
positive,"awesome replacement on my 2001 Yukon. I went up to the snow and evidently, the air got sucked out of the old ones lol..... Very Easy To Replace!"
negative,"Flap broke a few months after installed. There cheap. Got to look for a better built product. Some thing not made out of all plastic or a sturdier plastic. If you know of one I,d like to see it."
positive,"works great, great price"
negative,"Purchased the Autel Maxiscan MS300. It does not work on my 2005 V50 Volvo. It comes back with a ""Link Error"". Their Customer Service(?) Department is totally unresponsive. I did not expect much at this price and that is what I got, nothing. For me and my application 1 Star is all I give and that is one too many."
positive,"I'm impatient and hate waiting for my automated tailgate to go up/down. Therefore, I much prefer chucking my bags into the back seat...where they unfortunately slide all over the seat and floor. These hooks rock and allow me to easily just hang my bags and know that my stuff won't around."
positive,Good stock replacement piston ring set
negative,"I thought this would be an awesome tank protector given it is carbon fiber and had the Ninja logo on it. This item is VERY DISAPPOINTING. Not only is the Ninja logo just a sticker, but the adhesive is horrible and will not stick to the tank. I have contacted the seller requesting a replacement, but given the other reviews I believe this is a defect in the product."
positive,"Exact replacement, bolted right up.  No problems."
positive,Not to hard to install. Just have to remove the painted caps off the end of the existing roof rails first. My only complaint is the plastic knobs to tighten them is very difficult. My fingers and hands hurt like hell after tightning four knobs. I didn't want to damage them with pliers.
positive,Good brush and nice quality
positive,Brand new rubber smellin big fat deep tread tires for my Jeep arrived a day early THANK YOU!!!
positive,Got fr husband looks sassy. Nice product easy to install bought 2 one for both ends recommend highly  looks good
negative,"Totally bummed, worked fine for 3 months. Now it's showing faulty already! Pain to change now I get to do it again"
positive,Hi I purchased this locker last week. To be honest I was a little hesitant because of the price. After receiving the the locker and inspecting it I can tell you I was wrong to be weary of it. FOR THE MONEY this is probably the best locker in the market. I put this in my yj with a manual axle disconnect on the front end so this was the best option for me. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Thanks for helping me get my jeep out of tight spaces.
positive,Accurate and solid
positive,And it works. Fixed my P0300 code on a Chrysler 200 S.
negative,Works as it should but the vacuuum plug thing is very short and close to the unit making is difficult to use anything other than the skinniest of line. I had to use drip system hose....
positive,Once it fits perfectly there isn’t much to say and it did fit perfectly.
positive,Nicely made
positive,Thanks
positive,"Full synthetic, high mileage formulation & a great price. I’m in heaven."
negative,The cable is NOT at all as it is described in the picture!....It is very cheap and flimsy!
positive,Works as well as most GPS units.  The major difference is the battery backup that allows the unit to function for a couple hours after it's unplugged from the power source.  My husband frequently checks a route while in the house and the battery backup was a must.  If hubby is happy then it's worth it!
negative,Brush is okay and scraper. However handle does not extend very long so brush is not really good for SUVs
positive,"My trunk struts went out and I lived with it for a long time because I figured it'd be expensive and/or a pita to replace them. I was wrong on both counts. These struts are incredibly reasonably priced and taking out the old struts and installing these took less than 10 minutes. Great experience, very very happy to not have to worry about my trunk clocking me on the head anymore."
positive,Perfect replacement for original.  Love the nut on the end.
positive,They are just as shown. I put them up in the quest room and they were well liked!
negative,Decent brackets however they get in the way of the windshield wipers
positive,There are no more spills with this gas can.  It is almost impossible to do that with regular gas cans.
negative,"[[VIDEOID:d3e574f58b1f0eaeb18ccea795a4be4e]] 7 month UPDATE:<br /><br />It's been approximately 7 months. It's been exposed to the elements 24/7. The cover is showing cracking from the material. Little tears are forming, just by removing and installing. I feel it's becoming more brittle. This was probably taking off 10 times in total during the 7 months. I'm in southern California, so not much rain that I can test the waterproofness. the sun has taken a toll and is degrading the fabric. I expect about one year life cycle for this.<br /><br />The cover fits well. Thin material, 2 layers at best...not 5 as advertised. Silver metallic exterior with thin liner, similar to fabric softener.<br />Charging port zippered area with zippered driver side opening is nice.<br />Comes with 4 straps at each corner where the wheels are and there is a buckle clasp in the middle to tighten down and prevent from blowing away. This really helped when the santa ana winds picked up. held it down. no problem.<br />Seems to be waterproof..tested a pool of water for 1 min.<br />Time will tell, if this holds up 1 year from now."
negative,It works on a budget. But I recommend actual getting the proper replacement.
positive,"I know this is intended to be a perfect fit on 2000-2006 ZR, but this fit my 97 ZR 580 really well. The pic I’ve included is not the best; and I don’t have the straps tightened down, but it gives you an idea. Very happy. Expensive, but after putting it on, I doubt any aftermarket cover could come close in fitment and quality. Has a zippered door for gas tank. Here is a description for this cover from another seller:<br /><br />OEM Arctic Cat snowmobile trailerable cover, part number 5639-018.<br /><br />Features;<br />Excellent longevity from specially treated canvas<br />Adjustable windshield strap provides a custom windshield & mirror fit<br />Fits low, mid, and high windshields and mirrors<br />Features 4 super-snug cinch-down straps on the sides<br />Adjustable Velcro front fasteners around the spindles<br />Easy-access, zippered gas cap panel<br />Trailerable<br /><br />Fits the following 121"" models:<br /><br />1995-2007 Z 121"" track<br />1997-2005 ZL 121"" track<br />1993-2006 ZR 121"" track<br />1995-2002 ZRT 121"" track<br />1991-1998 EXT 121"" track<br />1985-1998 Cougar 121"" track<br />2002-2008 T660 Trail 121"" Track<br />1999-2002 Thundercat 121"" track<br />This cover was designed to fit perfectly on 2000-2006 ZR body styles, but will fit more models"
positive,Fits fine. Works fine. Exact replacement for OEM filter.
negative,The magnet on diesel cap was broken. This was second set we bought and I can say the magnet needs to be glued on not screwed nad needs to be much larger. Also missing the magnet for DEF.
positive,"This hepa filter provides clean air and doesn't damage my cars air conditioning system. Its thick and catches all the nasty bacteria and dirt that my car takes in. It's made durable, is easy to install and is very affordable. Great value"
positive,"Installed on my 73 500 (50hp) Merc no problem ;however, had to use hose clamp to compress and slide into pump housing-make sure you get blades in correct direction --mark old before you take out."
positive,"Works great for listening to alternator bearings, water pump bearings, fuel injectors, etc..  Much safer than putting your ear to a long screwdriver, and works much better!"
negative,Most convex mirror are round and there is a continuous image starting from the side of your car. With these the image starts about 2 feet away from the car and I could not adjust to this after having round mirrors for 40 years. Just got done peeling them off with acetone.<br /><br />If you like that image or can adjust to it then they may be great for you.
negative,Much thinner than original. Cannot use factory countersink bolts with these hinges.
positive,holds a 16 OZ and 20 OZ cup well along with any size bear can.
negative,The brackets are rusting very bad after only 6 weeks...
positive,thank you
positive,Good quality
positive,There are no reviews on this listing less than 5-stars.
negative,"This Kit does not come with enough oil to change a 60 HP Merc big foot like it syas it does. Emailing the Company does not good either. I now have to order another quart of the oil and pay shipping again! Also, New Gasket comes for oil drain plug but not for the lower unit. Would not recommend this over priced kit to any one."
positive,"I like these pads.  I use them along with a 3&#34; backing plate on my 6&#34;Griot's dual action polisher.  I prefer to use Griot's polishing and waxing pads due to their consistent quality.  Applying wax or polishing with cheap pads makes little sense to me, so I don't mind paying a bit more for the Griot's pads.  They also clean up very will and will last through numerous uses."
positive,Perfect fitment and good quality
positive,Easily replaced the support on my 2006 VUE.  No longer hit my head because of the gate not going fully up.
positive,Works great!
positive,Fast delivery at fair price.
positive,They stick very well. Don't listen to the other reviewers who didn't know how to apply them. Very nice touch in my opinion to the interior
positive,fit perfectly
positive,"I wanted made in the USA floor jack, but at the moment I only found one mfg; Hein-Werner and their products come at a price (over $400 for a 3-ton jack). Knowing this is made in China, I wanted to have 1-ton margin (my car weighs 2-ton) as many Chinese-made jacks have poor reputation (I would not lift a 3-ton vehicle with this jack).<br /><br />Overall quality seems good for a Chinese product, but after several use the front wheel shaft seems to have bent by 2-3mm (one wheel touches the ground but the other idles unless loaded) but does not affect use. All 4 wheels are made of steel and seem robust; they probably would not explode as would on some resin-made wheels.  The rubber on the lifting pad is a nice addition.  Lifting is easy; long bar allows less force to exert, and the bar is detachable so make it in 1/2 length. Even after contacting the vehicle, it lifts reasonably quick.<br /><br />I've debated this against Arcan's 3.5-ton all-steel jack, but Arcan did not include shipping so I went for this.  However, expect this to be as heavy as all-steel jack, but I value durability over light weight on a floor jack for safety. Be careful when you lift this off the ground/floor so as not to break your back.<br /><br />One last note; the black paint on the wheels will come off after use.  I don't know why these jacks/jack stands are painted, knowing that the paint will come off easily.<br /><br />UPDATE ON MAR/2018: Still holding up strong.  I even left it in rain for several times but no rust was noted thus far.  Occasionally, I apply some Mobil-1 synthetic grease at moving points.  The rubber pad is wearing out so I'd have to replace it on my own.  It is too bad that some recent reviewers noted failure of a bolt; the mfg might have switched to lesser grade materials to keep the cost down......That is a serious safety hazard."
positive,Works great.  Easy to install.  Exactly as described.
positive,SO GLAD I FOUND THESE FOR MY CAR
positive,"For the cost, Works. On the cheap side, feels cheap.<br /><br />Update: They sent out another one to replace the malfunctioning one without being asked. They have all been working properly and the company is very easy to work with."
positive,"I didn't buy a Curt 13149 Class 3 hitch. Instead I had UHaul install their 2&#34; 10,000lb hitch (2,000 more than this one and 3 bolts on each side to install it) which has a larger safety chain hook up than this one! I paid $40.00 for the installation + they offered a lifetime warranty for $5.00 which I took! The price was the same, but if you make the appt. on line, the price is $109.00 for the hitch. I'm sure Curt is a wonderful hitch, but for the install price, you can't go wrong. I don't work at UHaul either, I just liked the deal I got! I didn't have electrical hookup, because mine was for a bike rack."
negative,It say it comes with 8 but I only received 4 even the packaging it was in said 8. I like them but wished it wasn’t false description.
positive,"This adapter is big bucks, I would have never bought it at full price but one came up in the return section and I got a great deal on it. It has a few scratches but who cares. I have used it twice and it makes life a lot easier on installing and removing 4l80e transmissions. Its most likely the best adapter on the market. If you do a lot of transmissions its a must."
positive,Gives tires a nice shine which has lasted a few weeks for me - much longer than anything else I have ever used. A little pricey but worth it.
positive,"Really great value for the money, it has been installed in my vehicle for a couple of months now and seems to have no issues. I would highly recommend this"
positive,"Perfect fir for my worn out Excursion Brake pedal cover.  Easy to install.  This is something you should get at the first sign of wear on yours, because it is so cheap and makes an immediate difference."
positive,"Husband loves it. Feels sturdy, already been through a few car washed 👍🏻"
positive,Quality is excellent and fit is perfect.  Arrived quickly and would highly recommend this item.
positive,These add a lot of class and a nice finishing touch to my truck. It forced my wife to get involved as she has had years of applying wall paper to do it correctly for me. I just was all thumbs but she got them on and they look outstanding. I  don't fear the Grand kids climbing in to the back seat area anymore. They appear to be durable but time will be the judge of that.
positive,"I stumbled upon this last year in Walmart and the first time I used it, I loved it.  The directions were easy to follow and my car's shine is unstoppable.  I use it on my car every time I wash it and there is never a greasy residue or anything.  We now use it on all the cars and it brings out the shine.  No more putting wax on and then removing it.  This is the best stuff.  I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to spend all their day washing, waxing and then buffing your car.  In my personal opinion I think it is just as nice or maybe nicer than wax."
positive,Works exactly like it should.  So much cheaper here too.  Perfect fit and easy replacement. Can't go wrong with this.
positive,Perfect for my truck bed
positive,"All I can say is that this double laser device WORKS!  No more getting too close to walls or the other car or getting too far inside the garage.  Oh, did I mention that it is soooooo easy to install?"
negative,For short term or limited use these will be just fine. Not sure I would use them for rough off-road use or constant shaking or abuse.
positive,"Fit my 2007 heritage softail, quality seems good."
positive,Replaces cheap black plastic valve stem covers
positive,Lights up the road
positive,It fits perfect and protects seats from everything<br />Nice product  i had one and got this<br />For other seat
negative,"Fits OK, thicker than it needs to be."
positive,"Every time my husband comes home from a long trip, it seems like we need to dig out the jumper cables to get his car started.  What a relief to find something that will keep the charge alive even when he's gone!  This trickle charger appears to be sturdy and well made, and it's nice that no outlet is required.  Time will tell just how effective it is!"
positive,"These are fantastic for mitigating the glare from oncoming headlights, and that they can go over my glasses is great."
negative,Difficult to open from the get go! Couldn't remove it at all after just a month of use. Had to break it!
positive,Nice and looks great. Has a blue hue to it but still looks white enough to keep the cops from pulling you over.
positive,great part
positive,Worked right for my 2007 Kia Sedona. It's been 21 months and still haven't had to replace it.
positive,Installation is quick.  The improvements in throttle response is very noticeable.  I found the city setting works fine for me.  The sport and sport + are very sensitive.  I no longer have the noticeable throttle lag that I did before.  Much nicer driving truck now.
positive,Just hook it up and blows out all the water out of the lines.
positive,Exactly as described! Easy to install! They look amazing and we have them now on all the trucks! and we will order them again as needed!
positive,"Perfect fit for my car (Input your car year/make/model) to make sure it's good fit.  Besides that, it's an excellent product.  Royal Purple all the way!  Love it!"
positive,"Absolutely love it!! It sparkles so much, exactly what I wanted. Good price and fast shipping. I received it much earlier than expected. I have gone through prime shine and the license plate frame is still doing great! I've washed it several times and no crystals have come out!! Love this license plate frame. 11/11/16 is still looks great and sparkles"
positive,"I use to just use the bag from the gas station/convienance store to throw my trash in, but it won't stay on the emergency brake handle or stay open.  But this trash stand stays open, stays put and is easy to throw stuff into it without missing.  It takes liquids well.  Putting a bag in it as a liner for easy clean out is a thought...but it takes away from it's coolness factor."
positive,"These are super easy to install, and give the truck a quality finished appearance."
positive,"great product, fast shipping thx"
positive,"Super easy install, and came with everything down to wire crimps."
positive,very good
positive,"My car (a 2011 Mercedes-Benz SL550) uses projector lens bi-xenon HID bulbs for both low and high beams, but it also has a pair of reflector lenses with halogen bulbs used for the ""flash"" feature, and for fill-in when the bi-Xenons are in high-beam mode.  I recently replaced my worn out bi-Xenon HID bulbs with new ones that have a 6000K color.  That brighter, whiter light made the halogen fill-in bulbs look very yellow, so I went in search of a solution and found these LED bulbs.  Since they are just used for flash and fill-in, I was not too concerned with beam pattern or output. My biggest concern was fit and compatibility with my car's bulb monitoring system (often called a ""CAN-bus"" system).  These bulbs promised ""plug -and-play"" installation, no errors, excellent light output, the ability to focus the beam pattern.<br /><br />PLUG AND PLAY: On my car, this was not the case.  Most H7 bulb mounts have a simple wire clip holding them in place that should easily fit over these LED bulbs, but my car uses a complex metal ""carrier"" designed to snap over the back of the bulb and then twist-lock into the headlight housing.  Since these LED bulbs have a large heat sink and fan unit on the back, this carrier would not fit over that.  Fortunately, the retainer ring on these bulbs is removable to supports their focus feature.  I removed that and used a Dremel tool on my car's bulb carrier to enlarge its opening so it would slide over the front of the bulb, then I replaced the retaining ring.  I don't necessarily fault the manufacturer of these bulbs for this issue since most H7bulbs housings use a simple wire clip.  I suggest checking your car's housing before assuming it will be plug-and-play.  The wiring connector was a simple plug-in which fit securely, and my headlight housing has plenty of room to accommodate the large heat sink and fan housing on the bulb.<br /><br />NO ERRORS: The bulbs work just fine and I get no bulb errors.  Standard H7 halogen bulbs draw 55w each, and I believe these LEDs are rated at 50w each.  There is a small plastic box on the wiring lead that may be a resistor to increase current draw and avoid errors.<br /><br />LIGHT OUTPUT and FOCUS:  Since I am just using these bulbs for flash and fill-in, I am not really concerned about light output.  Just to test them, I switched off the main bi-Xenon headlights and the held the stalk in the ""flash"" position.  I think if I  were using these bulbs as my sole lighting source, they would be disappointing.  Their light may be brighter and whiter than halogen bulbs, but it's not very uniform or ""full"".  There are dark spots in the beam pattern and the further the light travels, the more it looks ""foggy"".  This isn't really a defect in the bulbs, but just the way LED bulbs retrofitted to a halogen reflector housing will perform.  Factory LED headlights use specifically-designed lenses to properly project the light.  I did try the focus feature which involves twisting and adjusting the depth of the the bulb, but it made no real difference.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with these bulbs, but I am not sure I would recommend them as a primary light source in a reflector housing.  I would suggest replacing just one and then comparing it to the other stock halogen to see if the LED gives adequate illumination for safe driving."
positive,"I love it,, mounted it above the door handle and now i don't wreck my back reaching for ,,, well nothing,, before this there was nothing to grab on my motorhome screen door,,,nothing in reach that is."
positive,"Perfect fit, went right on. Exactly right for my application (Mazda 3 hatch)"
positive,Fit as OEM.
positive,"DOESN'f  grip well on up scale carpet, but works really well on base grade (almost napless)car floor."
positive,This is just a good quality Muffler clamp.
negative,This replacement did not fit in the original screw holes.  The bottom hole is about an 1/8th  in. off from the original screw hole. Everything else is fine.
positive,Fit good and works great
positive,Exact match to reservoir in my 05 equinox. Comes with 2 rubber seals. No pins included. Quality product.
positive,"Very bright, easy to put in. BUT interferes with radio IN 2007 pontiac G6"
positive,Most will need a couple in the next little while and this set will provide the buyer with lawn mower hose and garden hose repair of a few types of hoses.  For specialized hose sizes buy individually or go to the hardware store down the road.  Good buy.
positive,Fit Perfectly on 02 Silverado 2500HD Duramax.  Much less cost compared to OEM.  After all this is a rubber based product that is easy to replace.  So purchasing an expensive OEM does not make sense where other times it does.  It all depends.  Don't forget to add blue locktite on the threads when replacing otherwise it may come lose from vibration.
positive,Nice to be able to separate items when you need to
positive,"This harmonic balancer puller set is great quality. It's sturdy, and the case fits all the pieces in it very well. The pieces all fit together and will work great when they are needed. My only complaint is the case the tool came in was open when shipped, and all the pieces shifted everywhere. It didn't break anything, but it seems like closing the clips would have been an easy fix."
positive,Perfect accessory for a 2&#34; hitch ball - easy on and easy off. You will never lose it because it stays in place with the attached tether.
positive,"Product is exactly what is says it is.  License plate mounting frame.  Volvo cars have an odd mount spacing for US plates, and need to use this device.  I like the concept but not the application.<br />Bracket design is flawed.  One side is taller than the other, but a license plate is flat.  The picture is not exactly what I received - but the description matches perfectly.  I should have done a little more research, and can blame no one but myself.<br /><br />Installed 2001 Volvo S80.  Had to put in some spacers on the short side to lift the plate for a better fit ,  but not too much or the nuts would not have any threads to connect.  I cannot think of any US license plate that would fit this bracket without damage.<br /><br />This amazon item came with mounting nuts.  I painted the bracket and nuts black."
negative,This was totally defective. It had the consistency of water and it did not work at all. Ended up having to throw it out. Total waste of money!
positive,Useful and sturdy. Could be slightly longer. Well made
negative,The SET screws keep coming loose.
negative,Too tall to work with my trailer. Well built
positive,You have to have this!
positive,This plate arrived very fast. Doesn’t appear to have any damage. It is a gift. So I don’t know any more about it.
positive,as advertised
positive,Tough to put on but it’s very nice and soft.
positive,"Replaced the compressor on a 06 Sorento. Fit was perfect and no problems thus far, although it's only been on a few weeks.<br />Living in Az. I can only hope I get tens years out of this one.<br />Four stars until it has been up and running for awhile.<br />And yes, you add PAG oil.<br />Update: After 4 years I discovered the compressor was leaking refrigerant-- but I was able to get by a couple more years after using some stop leak coolant product. All things considered it's B- or C+ grade."
positive,I liked everything- Beautiful and well worth the price!
positive,Tiss a nice cheap cover it is not water proof and the little lock provided is a joke.  It has a nice fit and was easy to put on just wish they had marked the front the first time
positive,Great product although it is a slight bit too big when placing in the area it goes into... soon molds its way into the right fit esp with this heat in Texas. you can add some coins into the back part of it but like all mini's not much room to get to this area.... good product for protecting the plastic underneath from scratching.
positive,Perfect fit. Working nice. Applied some gasket to seal it up
negative,Everything about this little trash bin is perfect for my car. The reason for 3 stars is the adhesive on the velcro fails in hot weather. I cleaned the plastic area in the car where bin was to placed with alcohol. I attached the bin as per the directions. The car sat unused in a cool garage overnight. I drove the car to work the next day the car was parked in a sunny area. When I can out for lunch 4 hours later the bin had fallen off and the velcro strip came with it. I have purchased extra strength velcro strips hopefully it will hold the bin to the plastic in the car during hot weather temps.
positive,Had no issues using and it really helped in aiding the installation....if you follow instructions.
positive,Items arrived packed well for the shipping and as described on Amazon.
negative,"To small for a full size truck F 150. Says it will fit,but there not long enough. Not recommended for a trucks!"
positive,Quite sturdy and seen to be staying on the vehicle so far.  Wind noise is quite minimal.<br /><br />Very well packed.<br /><br />Tip:. The sorento roof rails are NOT parallel to each other.  The racks won't appear to fit if you get them too close to the front or rear of the vehicle.  Just get them positioned properly and all is Good 👍
positive,"I wanted to really love this, but it’s okay"
negative,Did not fit over my mirror!
positive,Went together rather easily . Looks good and fits perfectly.
positive,The box came really damaged. It went together just fine.
positive,Smaller than expected
positive,"Just installed on 2003 Tundra 3.4L last week, time will tell how long they last."
positive,My dad said these worked perfect for what he needed.
negative,Chinese Delphi Alternator. It bolts up fine just the leads are in all the wrong locations. Unless you want to modify your existing wire lengths stay away. The instructions in the box state all this trickery. Would not work on my 2006 Honda Accord v6 without extensive rewiring.
positive,Bought a gas shock that came without new ball joints. So after a quick amazon search I found these. For me I could have used 3/8 thread instead of 5/16 but these work fine for the price and got them fast.
negative,"This receiver lock seems to work ok but despite the rubber covering around the lock, and the O ring, the lock assembly fills with water whenever it rains.  To counter this I have packed the whole lock with grease, but this is messy and should not be necessary.  Without the grease, the lock would rust up and become useless."
positive,i can't really tell any significant boost in performance. maybe runs smoother on acceleration? i wouldn't have noticed that if i hadn't placed this filter so it is probably my imagination. it is a little taller than the fram filter i took out and i had to leave off/open on of the metal clips on the breather box.
positive,"Great suds, Slick coat, smells nice, easy on your paint and hands. The Absolute Best I have found so far and I accept any samples from any company who thinks they can outperform Optimum Car Wash.<br /><br />Peace"
positive,Fits my BMW key fob perfectly! Prevents damages and scratches when the keys are accidentally dropped. Just what I was looking for.
positive,Product works great. Fits well. No issues
positive,Spray bottles work as advertised and I like them.
negative,"Too small to clip over visor and cover the hole left from removing the broken previous mirror....  it does work, and lamps are bright."
positive,This was exactly what we needed for our vehicle. Had never installed one before and it was very simple
negative,This product was purchased as an add-on item to my order. It is a very cute license plate holder but the shoes as NOT pink more of an organish mix with pink. But still cute.  I placed it on my mothers vehicle which looks adorable. lol
positive,"Easy to put on the mailbox, and has stood up fine in crazy Georgia weather.  I would repurchase."
positive,works good
negative,"I think this is a pretty good alternative than spending $50 at the dealer, but I really wish it came with connectors at the bottom as well when using it as a &#34;hammock&#34; type net.  I have it in a 2014 Ford fusion that already had hooks in the trunk.  Its a little large but again for the money its an ok compromise."
positive,Very effective at blocking out sun from front and side and window sun reflection on car in front of you.  Easy to adjust height in both front and side positions.
positive,"First it is a spray obviouly , similar to auto undercoating . Use it in area's you can't reach or put in mat material . Remember one coat is not much thicker than paint. So you need several coats to do much . Don't expect spraying fenderwalls with one coat or even two will make huge difference . It really helps . Tap a fender before you use it and after if you want to just spray .remove the plastic inner fender and spray underside of fender . I gotta believe it will help protect it from rust. I was very happy with results on my truck which has noisy exhaust . It with mat  material made big difference love the trucking more on trips"
positive,"This is a great product. A bit more expensive than a lot of other similar items on Amazon, but this is made with much more quality. It is very sturdy and fold up flat for easy storage when not in use."
positive,Just what I was expecting very affordable an great same as the dealer quality at better price
positive,I haven't had a remote for my old Odyssey for years because the Honda unit cost too much. This was reasonable and I was able to easily figure out how to link it to the car.  Just do a search on YouTube for instructions.
positive,Perfect replacement air filter for a 2013 fiat pop c.
positive,Shipped fast. Everything is as expected. I'm happy. Using it for my cabin outhouse.
positive,Love this amazing gadget! I have used it three times to help friends jumpstart their cars and it works flawlessly!
positive,These save an enormous amount of time compared to the average clay bar
positive,"UPDATE (4/5/2021): Completed the installation 2 days later after getting my serpentine belt tool. The clearance between the frame and the tensioner bolt was less than needed to accomplish the procedure with a socket and wrench. It required a special tool. However, I still had to grind down the edges of the tool to get the socket onto and off the bolt. That was done, and the alternator was installed. The new alternator has been performing ever since it was installed 3 months ago. Output voltage while running is 14.2–14.5 volts.<br /><br />Original Review (1/27/2021):<br />The alternator appears to be an exact match in terms of its physical size and configuration as the one that is being replaced. The car I am installing it in is at another location, and I was unable to complete the installation due to the fact that I did not have the serpentine belt tool necessary to remove the belt.<br /><br />Inside the box was a small piece of paper, a leaflet, that said INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS on the outside. Hahaha. Not one word as to HOW the alternator was to be installed. A decent set of instructions would have said the clearance between the frame and the idler pulley was barely more than one inch and a special tool would be needed. With that bit of information, the replacement might have been accomplished in less than 30 minutes."
negative,"Had this for just a couple of months, and want to wait to do the review to ask I had used it for a while. At first the material seem like it might hold up it seemed thick enough. But within the first couple of weeks and started to feel simply like having a towel and as opposed to a thick had to sit on. As of right now I cannot even tell that it's there because it simply is flattened all the way and does not recover after being sat on. I would return it but it's past the time of the return.<br /><br />I would not recommend this in with search elsewhere for a more prominently that pad for your chair this is not it. Do not think this would work very well in the auto use either because of your city and for a long period of time it doesn't seem to stay put, and seems to flatten out within just a couple of minutes"
positive,Worked great.<br />It went on exactly as advertised. I was amazed how easily it worked.<br />Just make sure you use their Deglazer first.
positive,Just what I wanted worked well
positive,As advertised.  Simple to install.  2004 Silverado 2500HD.  I didn't remove the spare tire and had plenty enough room.<br />I mounted it on drivers side rear above bed tie down.  Total install time with looking for tools etc was 35 minutes.
positive,"Just a little bit of a ""bump"" in the passenger side mat.<br />I also have no idea what the ""warmth"" rating is for but these mats are great for the price."
negative,Truck is very shiny but not really sure it did a great job on the small scratches & swirls etc etc<br />They are harder to see cuz truck is so shiny overall an 8.5 out of 10<br />I haven't really found a product that makes swirls & scratches dissappear
negative,Didn’t fit
positive,Delivered as advertised. I am happy with it.
positive,good load tester
positive,Worked perfectly and shipping fast. Don't forget to torque per specs!
positive,"My basket is larger than front basket, so I ordered 2. Put them on rack. They are loose. Perfect for farmers market or small grocery list."
positive,These are a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and they are perfect.  They look better than I expected.  They are made very well and the color is vivid.  She is going to absolutely love them.
positive,great product
negative,Smell is something to get used to. It takes a bit of this  product to get a good shine on certain surfaces. Be careful of which surface this product goes on.
positive,Great product
positive,"Best product in this category I've found. Works great for our fleet of 5 cars, making tire rotations and feeling safe a piece of cake!"
positive,Works perfectly in our RV
positive,Nice. Fast Delivery. As advertised.
positive,ON TIME AND AS DESCRIBED. wILL RECOMMEND .
negative,This is a review of the incompetent ad description and specifications provided by Valspar and Amazon ad editors. There is no material specification provided as to the chemical type of paint this is supposed to be. It also requires a hardner - which is not stated in the ad or specs. The product has a 10% one star rating which when coupled with the incompetent ad - would prevent any intelligent person from purchasing it.
negative,"The picture is not correct.<br />Filter media is much thinner and it is less folds than an OEM.<br />The  rubber edging is way too flexible to keep the shape of the air box.<br />It fits my RX 350 fine but takes more effort to put it in because of the very flexible edge.<br />With less and thinner filtering media, I would not trust this filter to last 12K miles.<br /><br />Overall this filter is well bellow par and since it is not much cheaper than OEM, my advise - stay away from it and get better filters.<br />Amazon should change the picture to display the mediocrity of this filter."
negative,"The belt in this kit didn't fit my 2006 Honda Pilot EX (2WD).  This is our 4th Honda with the J series V6 and this is the first time I've tried using an aftermarket belt.  The tensioner went in just fine.  The belt in this kit was easily about an inch short of being able to fit around the pulleys. No amount of moving the tensioner could compensate for how short the belt was.  I went to the dealer and got the correct belt and had no issues getting the factory belt on.  My advice would be to buy the tensioner and get the belt from the dealer.  I recognize there are a lot of people who use this kit and have no problem getting everything installed. This to me seems like a quality control problem with the belt production.<br /><br />Maybe, I should have just gone to the dealer and spent the extra cash for the factory belt.  I ended up paying a buck forty for the gates kit, plus 51 for the dealer belt.  Just for giggles, I asked the parts guy at the local dealership if he'd be willing to come down on their prices for the tensioner and belt.  The parts guy at the dealership was willing to get me the belt and tensioner for around $245 plus tax.  Spending the extra 50-60 to reduce my frustration would have been worth it."
negative,"These do not fit an H9 bulb as described in the product title without modifying the bulb, and the ceramic broke the first time I plugged it in. Don't waste your money if you have H9 bulbs."
positive,"The baddest boy of the bad boy hitch receivers for the rv. Fits around a 4&#34;x4&#34; bumper and you'll probably never get it off after putting it in. This beast was tough to install and prompted me to use a rubber mallet to set the vertical plates. That said, now that it's on, it won't be coming off and I've never been more confident in placing my cargo hitch in back and having it still there when we stop for the night.<br /><br />The support brackets are monsters. Added safety and protection in case a weld is no bueno. Expensive and well built. Worth the price for some added peace of mind."
positive,Great price quality parts
negative,"Axle received, cap off in the box, grease everywhere. Should have learned a lesson with ordering issues from Detroit Axle previously. Poor packaging. Put a"
positive,I used these in my motorhome exterior storage doors to install gas struts to hold doors- worked great. Very sturdy and strong yet drilled with ease.
positive,Outstanding Product Video!  Explained very well and answered all my curiosities regarding the product.<br />Excellent example of how to make a product video!  I plan to purchase this in the coming weeks for<br />installation on interior of A.R.E. aluminum pick-up truck topper interior surfaces.
positive,These do the job.
negative,"This is a great looking Bumper and the bumper itself does go together well. However the bracket that attaches to the truck for the bumper to attach to is off where the bracket mints to bumper about an inch, fortunately, I happen to have a welding fab shop, and was able to modify the bumper side bracket to fit onto the truck. Otherwise it would’ve had to be returned. This was supposed to be a fit for my 2017 Chevy Silverado<br />I added different shackles for my truck<br />A big plus for the fact you can reinstall the sensors"
positive,I purchased these for my 2011 Camaro after I had the tires re-inflated with nitrogen.  The cheap plastic green caps weren't as deep as the OEM valve stem caps and kept snapping in half because the tire techs would over tighten them.  These Green Aluminum Alloy caps were just the ticket and I expect them to last a long long time.<br />They arrived quickly and well packed!
positive,Perfect and great price
positive,"Get a good socket set and wrenches. Take the old running boards off. Then, It's easy, you use the old bolt to screw in the new steps. It took me about an hour. And it looks so good. And it makes it much easier to get in. I love these!"
positive,"This product came with everything it showed, and works perfectly"
positive,"Does what it says.<br /><br />If you're having trouble like I was getting the clutch plate cover off after removing the bolt, try this: run the car. Remove the bolt and go for a drive, I found that after driving for about an hour, the clutch plate worked itself off enough to get your fingers under it and easily remove it.<br /><br />If you're buying this because your belt broke off the connector plug (good job GM engineers) then you can save yourself some money if you are handy with a solder iron. Simply remove the clutch, grind back the ceramic surrounding the two leads in the remaining piece of the plug with a razor. Solder some speaker wire about 4 inches long onto the leads, other end onto the plug, or build your own connector. Then use JB Weld or other non-conductive epoxy to hold the wires into place so the solder connection won't break when hitting bumps, and prevent the wire from contacting the pulley/belt. Let dry overnight and reinstall."
positive,"okay I bought  more than one and have already reviewed it. But I will do it again and add something you need to know if you live where it is hot. I bought one, liked it so much got another one for our other vehicle. lots of slots for CDs plus I like the other departments along with having a pen at arms length.  Beware though, This never crossed my mind, it being leather, but make sure you have CDs in some kind of protector. I took mine out of their protector and just slid them in the slots, One day I tried to pull a disk out and it was stuck. Due to extreme heat in a closed car, it heats up the leather, hate to say it but I have about 4 disks ruined. So i know now to use a protector in the slots."
positive,Installed several of these bulbs today.  They work very well.
positive,"I drive a Nissan 350Z and I love my car!  The one thing I don’t love but these cars are known for is how loud the road noise is when riding in them.<br /><br />I always thought it was just something that I would have to deal with.  I would turn up the radio and tune it out.  Then I found out about sound deadening mats.<br /><br />While I am not a car audio enthusiast although I do enjoy listening to music in my car, I thought this may just help with blocking the road noise so I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Now when it comes to auto mechanics I am at a complete loss. I read how to apply these panels and realized that I could indeed do this - and I did without any problem!  This roller made all of the difference - you have to be able to press the mat completely into every crevice to have it adhere to the metal completely.  By using this roller, it is the perfect size to be able to work within tight areas to get the mats installed absolutely flush.<br /><br />The majority of my issue came from the rear of my car above the rear axel, where the spare tire is stored. Besides the plastic housing there is just metal there and noises would reverberate through that area.  This tool was particularly helpful throughout this area as there are multiple dips and indents that without this tool I would have struggled to get the mat in correctly.<br /><br />I placed each panel in place, molded it to the curves of that location using this tool, trimmed off any excess then removed the backing and stuck the panel in place.  After lining the area with these panels I couldn’t believe the difference it made!<br /><br />This is definitely a product I would recommend. It made all the difference in properly installing this product - right tool for the specific job.<br /><br />This is an awesome tool if you are considering installing sound deadening mats - I wouldn’t install them without it."
positive,This is the best I have ever used.  Easy to use and efficient.
positive,Good quality
positive,We got tired of the dog hair and scratch marks on the back seats of the Bronco and were so happy to get these in the mail.  They are so well made and fit the seats of the Bronco perfectly.  My only complaint is that I did not get these sooner!
positive,Needed one for a 94 Nissan Pickup. Works perfectly!
positive,Came fast and fit my car. I now have windows that roll up.
positive,Good for polishing most anything;
negative,"I purchased this hitch cover, it arrived quickly, and is a really nice looking product with a quality feel. It comes in three pieces (the part that goes into the hitch, the emblem, and a piece of self-sticking foam). However, and this is a rather big ""however"", it comes without the hardware to put it together. Nowhere in the description of the product does it explain that you need to purchase screws.  The package it comes in is sealed, and there wasn't any indication that there was even a place the screws should have been.<br /><br />Silly as it sounds for such a simple product, it also does not have any installation instructions, so I am not sure why I need the foam square or what size and type of screws the manufacturer recomends for attaching the two pieces together.<br /><br />If the package told me what size screws would work best (so I wouldn't have to figure it out at the hardware store), I would give this 4 stars. If this product came with the screws, I would give this 5 stars. It really is a nice hitch cover."
negative,no commet
positive,These covers fit well on my '14 Subaru Forester. Very easy to install and the material feels durable enough for the price.<br /><br />Happy.
positive,"I am so impressed with these floor mats. They fit perfectly and are the exact color of my Porsche Cayenne interior. I have purchased others and the color was always off, but this color is great. Why spend hundreds of dollars when you can get great quality for a fraction of the price.<br />P.S I am a female but the are so easy to install &#34;Even a man can do it&#34;."
positive,"Does exactly what it says it does,. This thing works great on everything I have used it on.  The key is you have to drag the item across the device several time for the demagnification to work.  If you just hold it in the middle, not only wont it get demagnetized, it may get more magnetized. I have used it on Tweezers, screw dicers big and small, teeny tiny screws from a watch, all with 100% success.<br /><br />Directions:  Press the button, hold the item with light pressure onto the surface of one side of the device.  Drag the item from side to side with slight pressure down two or three times. More times for larger objects.  Release the button when the item is on the side, not in the middle of the device.  check, repeat if necessary. You should be good to go!<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, please indicate that by checking the appropriate box below."
positive,"For what you pay, this is a really great pick up. Its comfortable, even after wearing it all day for 3 days straight, and can make a world of a difference if you take a hard fall."
positive,"I have a lot of leather furniture in my house. In addition, I also own quite a few leather bags, shoes and belts. Leather conditioners and cleaners can get very pricey so I was very pleased to find Leather Nova - a brand that I see myself repurchasing over and over again because it is very well priced and works wonders on my leather goods!<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services that I use personally and believe will be good for consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint."
positive,I paired these with the Bestop 42921-00 d-rings and they work just as I imagined.
positive,"Nice and well done. They do what you expect them to do and if you need to secure something, they work."
positive,Great double right angle aux jack!
positive,Curt produces quality items and this has worked well to keep our popup locked in place on our hitch. High quality.
negative,This is nice and is well made but hardly noticeable and way over priced
positive,"Very easy to install, it took me about 3mins to get this done."
positive,So far so good. No complaints. Seems to do the job
positive,none
positive,Color is bright and vivid! Love it!
negative,"Hard to install tabs at the end. Screw cracked the plastic the moment it caught in the metal. Looks good, but not a fun install."
positive,This replacement oil pressure switch for my older Jaguar is actually better made than the original.  It fit well and was easy to hook up and saved me a bundle of cash at the same time.  I recommend this replacement for any Jaguar or other vehicle that it fits.
positive,"Comes with the battery connections and clamps, works as describes, keeps you battery ready."
positive,"great price, good quality and super easy to install simple instructions to follow, going to buy more for my other cars"
negative,"The product arrived in apparently undamaged packaging.  Two bulbs packed together so tight I think they may have been damaged by their own compressed packaging.  One bulb a dust cap popped off.  I thought it would snap back into place but it refused.  It fit up flush and seated but nothing but gravity to hold it in place.  Both bulbs did NOT light up.  I replaced them, one at a time, with a spare known to be good and it is working.  But when I put these LED bulbs back in they do not come on.  I am very disappointed with these bulbs - two duds right out of the package...<br /><br />2ND REVIEW - A FOLLOW-UP:<br />My friend tells me to check the fuse because these are the first LED bulbs I have tried.  Sure enough - the fuse popped!  This is the first time in nearly 15 years that truck has blown a fuse.  After replacing the fuse now both bulbs are working.  But I'm going to keep a sharp eye on them and the circuit - don't need to burn down my truck over an LED bulb upgrade.<br /><br />3rd REVIEW - A FOLLOWING FOLLOW-UP:<br />After driving for many nights I have found these bulbs to be very dim.  The OEM reflectors are designed for a single-source bulb - a filament.  But these LED bulbs are covered in tiny LED lights - there is no one singe source of light.  This makes the light ooze out in all directions instead of reflect sharply into a focused pattern.  I replaced them and returned to conventional OEM style bulbs."
negative,"Inaccurate item description. These are for the mini fuse not the very small blade style like it shows. Seem to be of decent quality, though."
positive,Perfect organizer for your car. Lots of space to hold things!
positive,Recommended by my MINI dealer and it is the best! Easy application and great shine! The same wax that the dealers use!
positive,"Exact fit. Worked like a charm. Now only if Honda put these in a easy to access location. If you not too handy, not a DIY project. Total time in and out 3 hours."
positive,They work but there is probably better
positive,Every jeep should have this. 2 min installation and wat better than whats currently in its spot.
positive,Worked real good just like the factory one.
positive,"I bought these for my boyfriend a few months ago to wear while riding his motorcycle.  They work great, although the transition isnt quite dark enough for intense sunny days, hence the 4 star rating.<br /><br />The features I love about these is that he doesnt have to carry around 3 pairs of sunglasses.  He frequently rides for hours, and these transition nicely from day to night.  The venting on the side really works great to keep them from fogging up, and the lenses are open more on the side to allow him to see things to the right and left much more easily.  They stay put no matter how windy it gets."
positive,Just right.
positive,Cute and simple to put in
positive,Terrific product. Easy to purchase and apply. Recommend it for personal use and as a gift.
positive,Great product.  Fast shipping.  High quality part that made the exhaust system look better.  Also measurements are spot on for ID/OD
positive,"Awesome shield! Not only does it look great, it functions great as well. If i need a new one one day i will buy it again."
positive,"Ride nice, looks nice, installed in 4 hours. Adjustable links for the rear can be moved to raise the rear a little more if you like a small rake."
positive,got here in good shape.
positive,These work awesome for removing contaminants in your car paint that a regular wash won't remove. It's amazing how much smoother the paint is after using these.
positive,good product good quality
positive,Exactly what I needed for pulling a trailer. Truck didn’t come with it. Easy to follow Utube instructions and install. Worked perfectly with my truck and trailer.
positive,Great buy! It’s soft and protective!
positive,"I was a little skeptical based on the reviews. Some of the photos also make the seat cover look like it doesn’t fit well and looks sloppy.<br />While it is wrinkly out the box and not completely perfect, it fits well for a universal cover. My main goal is to save my leather seat from my English Mastiff’s claws.<br /><br />I was surprised by the feel and weight of the material. While I knew it would not be the canvas material, I was nervous that the nylon would be thin and flimsy. First impression, it seems quite durable.<br /><br />The fit is a bit tricky and took maybe 20min of tweaking. Parts feel like it is a little too snug, but with pulling and adjusting I got it in the right spots. The corner bits are a little tight around the head rests (not a deal breaker!) and the straps are a little tricky to adjust with the split seat. Again, just a lot of adjusting to get it how I want it.<br />The draw string to tighten the base of the cover is hard. There is no give with it so it just doesn’t feel like I can get it tighten enough. The ends of the draw string go up the side edges, so there is a lot of play in that string. It’s also super tricky to find a good place for the hooks, on said draw string, in the corners of the base. I see in the video that he “hooked them on behind the seatbelt” but there wasn’t a fantastic spot for that.<br /><br />I’m not loving how big the holes are for the seat belt buckles. More seat is exposed than I expected.<br /><br />Over all, it looks better in person than the photos I took. I’m excited at the clean look,  durable feeling, better than decent fit, and the color.<br /><br />My 4/5 is mainly due to the nylon drawstring (I anticipate having to make adjustments due to that) and how large the seat belt buckle cuts are.<br /><br />Will update if the cover becomes problematic."
positive,great sturdy product -
positive,love it
negative,listing say white light  but when received  its is red  can't use it
negative,"I like the fact that this switch looks like the original when installed. It does control the window. It is clearly not a direct replacement for a 1996 Suzuki Sidekick. It did not fit the door bezel without significant modification to the switch and the bezel. In order to hold it in place I had to install 4 ea. # 2 screws  through the plastic sides of the bezel and into the fins at the bottom of the switch. The electrical connector was a direct fit, which was a relief."
positive,Used to top up 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee coolant nearing minimum level.  OEM product at great price.
positive,Nice touch to my black Challenger with the black top package. I live in NJ and it covers a little of the &#34; Garden State&#34; writing on the bottom of the license plate but have no issues with local law enforcement so far.
positive,Great small packaging for motorcycle use.
positive,great
negative,I installed this bearing by the book all correct tourqe specs and all. It lasted less than 50 miles. You get what you pay for.
positive,I did a lot of checking to make sure this really did fit my mower and was very pleased that it was perfect for it and functions just like it's supposed to.
positive,These are great for panel lining. Don't press hard just lightly apply to surface. I used a Q-tip quickly dipped in isopropyl alcohol  to remove excess marker.
positive,all I wanted
positive,Excellent tire gauge.
negative,"The mat for the driver's side is not the shape of a Tucson Hybrid Limited 2023 floor but I did some cuts, and I gave a not bad shape. The rubber is not the best, is a little bit faded but for the price, we can't ask for more."
positive,Great wipers one slide out once but after sliding the blade back in place it's been perfect
positive,I mix it up by the soda bottle - the liter size.  I've marked on the bottle how much of this concentrate to add and another line for the amount of water.  Makes it easy for me to fill my car's windshield wiper fluid.  I have a couple of used soda bottles filled so that I always have some made up.  This stuff works just fine and the price is excellent for how much I get.
positive,"Nice heavy duty metal, should hold up just fine. Top notch Quality"
positive,Very well made!  Don't settle for anything less than K&N!
positive,It fit easily on my 2000 Kawasaki kx125.great product
positive,Good charger
positive,"Bought this just for a VW fuel filter, but all and all this set is great. Case is sturdy and pretty complete for my next jobs. Do not regret buying this at all, thought at first that the aluminum would shear but its pretty tuff"
negative,Ordered for my 2011 Tahoe.  Rear seat mats do not fit.  Called WeatherTech.  Their response was GM changed the floor shape for 2011.  So?  Why do they advertise and charge for custom fit mats if they don't bother to make them fit?  Why don't they acknowledge that up front before you buy them?
positive,It took me about three hours to install. It was a pretty tight fit length wise and then loose in the air box side. We'll see.
positive,Worked great. Fit perfectly
positive,"The price seemed a little high but you will get what you paid for.  The quality of the boot is very good, it fits perfectly on the Accugage and it will definitely do the job."
positive,It did fit my truck and i love it
negative,"This one strut is especially noisy, the other rear one is fairly quiet, but I guess you get what you pay for... I'm going to go to my local Napper and let them stick it to me."
positive,"Worked great, good size. Just take your time removing it from its backing. If you get frustrated, take a breather then come back"
positive,Starts up my old lawnmower!
negative,Doesn't work don't make a sound
positive,Put them in my 03 Sierra. Very awesome. They look and function outstanding! Great for drls and back up lights.
positive,Replaced original starter with this product. Installed the unit myself. Remember to label or remember which wire came off which bolt. Use the new nut and lock washer. Disconnect the battery and fully charge with your float charger. Installed bat and it started right up. A pleasant sound in mho. Its been 2 days since installation. If I have problems will definitely write an added comment.
positive,I have a 2004 Forester. I replace my old timing belt with this Gates one Saturday 6/20/2015 every thing fit as it should and quality looked good. Make sure you have torque wrenches and a friend. Total time about 6 hours total. Order a 21200AA072 Thermostat with this kit.<br /><br />It helps if you have sprocket wrenches for the cam gear and crank shaft pulley. I had to take off the cam gear to get the water pump on.<br />Order a 21200AA072 Thermostat with this kit.
negative,"Three stars because it works well but is a HUGE pain. I spent about 7 hours rubbing this mud off my car. Such a terrible experience. My arms and hands ached for two days. However, if this is what’s necessary to get the Xymol black wax to work well, then maybe it was worth it."
positive,Love this stuff.
positive,"Works like it should. Not super heavy duty, but it gets the job done."
positive,"Looks great and an easy install. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it is more gray then black. Otherwise, I'd recommend them to anyone."
positive,I like that it gives me comfort (skinny butt) and raises me in the drivers seat.
positive,[[VIDEOID:8a46bac13cc1489e2ecdb8510054d834]] Seems like a nice kit.  I like the design.  There are many tools in here you can use<br /><br />There are YouTube videos of how to use these sort of kits.<br /><br />I like the design and think it will work pretty well I hope
positive,GREAT BUY
positive,"This is the EXACT replacement for the one in my 2009 Honda FIT.  Honda's design for the little plastic nub that holds the cap while you are filling the washer tank, is poor.  The cap comes loose and falls down inside the engine when filling the washer tank.  So I instead used a piece of wire wrapped around the little ring to hold the cap in place to a nearby hose.  Works fine and it does not come off and fall down inside the engine any more!"
negative,Didn’t work out of the package. Waste of money don’t get this piece of crap.
positive,looks good
positive,"Although I'm not happy that these aren't made in USA, they fit perfectly. Even the wiring for the ABS sensor has the mounting insulators in the exact spot as OEM. My truck drives like new now. MOOG get your manufacturing back to USA!"
positive,Used this to repair a stripped thread on a BMW 325is exhaust.  Worked GREAT!  The kit comes with everything you need.  Just make sure to get the right size.
positive,"Used this to reseal the case on my kdx200 dirtbike after a full rebuild. Went on well with a small paint brush, seems to be holding up fine after a few rides. would use it again."
positive,"These are just the thing for do it yourselfers. They fit perfectly, and very easy to unistall the old ones, and pop these right in."
positive,Nice product for the money.  I recommend it.
positive,Great product
positive,"I have a 2005 Honda Pilot with 120,000 miles, failed emissions test, in 2015 at which time I was told would need sensors and converters with price range $1800.00 to $2500.00.  I found a independent mechanic who also failed emissions, he was puzzled as car did not exhibit any objective issues he would expect to be associated with such  codes ) he kept car and drove for 75 miles),, code was deleted and  I continued to drive with quarterly high end fuel and a good 100 mile highway trip for 70 -80 miles/hour speed.  Check engine light appeared again  in October 2017 and would not go off even with 93% octane gas, rechecked codes at Jiffy Lube in December 2017. My mechanic had retired so  I researched for something to try before major costly repairs in a car that still performed perfectly and now with only 132,000 miles.<br /><br />Over New Years weekend I took a 400 mile highway  round trip, filled tank with gas (no alcohol, expensive)  to clean out system, with just quarter tank of gas left I added bottle of CataClean and drove at top speeds,then  filled up with 93% , with only quarter tank gas put bottle #2, back on highway , check engine light went off.,  I filled up with  regular gas, drove through January 2018 without any problems,  To ensure emissions pass ( I live in Chapel Hill, NC) I put bottle 3 in gas tank with quarter tank of gas, got  on a road I could push petal to floor 3 days before inspection - came out with clean codes.<br /><br />This worked for me and I have had emissions codes for 3 years popping up.  Go figure, a car is a machine being diagnosed by another machine for emissions..<br /><br />  What is up with this county by county emissions law ?,  Does NC have emissions concern or not.  I could go to OBX where having plastic bags can bring a hefty fine, yet no emissions,  really the Sea and its inhabitants are more important than the air we all breathe.  I support both, just curious as to why is only dictated at county level."
negative,These are pretty but I ordered red and these are orange.I'm so disappointed.
positive,Looks great on the camper steps and easy to install
positive,Super basic but they’re super absorbing and super soft :)
positive,"I'm 5ft tall so seeing the complete rear of my car is hard, but with thi mirror my view if rear window and blind spots are no more."
positive,works surprisingly well on 45 year old tires
positive,Great
positive,I love this plate frame!  It looks so classy on my truck!  It's sturdy and the colors are beautiful!
positive,"I worked perfectly on my 1999 Hyundai Elantra GLS.  Very straight forward replacement, just make sure you have your breaker bar or some type of lever ready for taking off the old one."
positive,"Husband loves them, they are a little small"
positive,"Sizing was perfect, easy to use, easy to store, and does the trick."
positive,thank you
negative,They are not working well.
positive,Better than advertised
positive,"We use this filter after our soft water filter and boy does it make the water clear & tasteless! This like most filters need to have all the O-rings lubricated with a food safe lube. Otherwise, you will get leaks and become frustrated. Awesome deal and filter, definitely recommended!"
negative,This seems to work ok but the first one broke when I pushed it into the fuel line.  It feels very flimsy and I wouldn’t order this again.
positive,Great for my sponsor children's scrapbooks (each get their own flag stickers for their countries).  Just what i wanted.  Well made- not skimpy.
negative,Cheap !! Junk !!
negative,"aint installed it yet, I will see"
positive,Works for those gym cloths
positive,These type of scrapers are very good to clear ice on the glass. Plastic scrapers tend to pit when you scrape ice.
positive,"The blower level 1 didn't work, only 2, 3 and 4 would blow air through the vents. But with this replacement it fixed the problem. Now I don' have to run it at 2 all the time which sometimes gets too cold and I have to turn it off and on again after it starts to warm up."
positive,"Good new car smell, but smell does not hang around a long time"
positive,so easy to install
positive,"I live in Florida so it is always hot and rainy in the summer. Anytime I opened the window during the rain, it would stream water directly into the handle, door pocket and my left leg.<br /><br />I have these for my Acura TL also, and love them.<br /><br />IF YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CORRECTLY, you have no issues with &#34;grabbing&#34; or &#34;ruining windows\motor&#34;.<br /><br />The correct installation shows that near the side mirror, it is to be placed OUTSIDE the channel, not INSIDE. If you put it INSIDE (and I did at first), it will cause the window to grab, and the window motor is trying to wedge the window and the deflector in the small space. If you place the LIP OUTSIDE, it works like a champ. It tells you in the install sheet, but you have to look closely."
negative,Sold the truck before I had a chance to restore.
positive,"These are so much nicer than I was expecting! The fabric is nice and thick and very heavy duty! They wipe off easily and don't absorb messes. The ties that hold them onto the seat are very nice and I really like that the bottom tie is stretchy and not an adjustable strap with the plastic piece and a bunch of leftover strap to figure out what to do with. It is easy to pull it down and tuck it into the crease of the seat so you dont even know its there. Plus it helps to keep the bottom of the mat pulled down on the back of the seat. The top strap is just long enough to go around the headrest really well without a bunch of leftover strap (the top one is not stretchy).<br /><br />I put one mat in my husbands truck (A Dodge Ram) and one mat in my car ( A Scion Xb) and it fit both perfectly. I used it in the Dodge to cover the seat in front of my forward facing sons seat, and I used it in the Scion to cover the seat at the foot of my daughters rear facing seat (I just tucked it in at the bottom without trying to wrap the strap all the way around the seat - works just fine since the mat is somewhat slick so she cant get a foot hold on it enough to pull the bottom of it up). It works great for both instances!<br /><br />I am extremely pleased that I was able to receive this product for free in exchange for my completely truthful and impartial review. Even if I did have to pay for these, they are WELL worth the asking price to save your seats anymore unnecessary wear and tear. I HIGHLY recommend them!"
negative,My father is complaining it is missing the cover and that it will fly off during a rainstorm and scratch at the window. So no I'm not happy
negative,"I was tightening one of the four straps and it ripped off. I just passed the 1 month return/replace window. I like everything about this product, it lasted a few drives, but then a strap ripped off. I would really appreciate a second chance trying this item, if you could replace it. Thank you"
positive,These replaced my old wore out ones great
positive,"What a great idea!  My pocketbook is always on the front passenger seat and when I stop short or turn, it falls and the contents go everywhere.  When I use this holder, I know where my bag is and the contents stay  where they belong!"
negative,"I found the ""made to exacting tolerances for proper performance"" claim not quite accurate.  I needed a 31 tooth gear. This part had a 33 tooth gear. A precision gear shaft made to exact replacement tolerances should have made the old and new sensor gear shaft interchangeable. The shaft diameters were not the same and therefore not interchangeable. So, unfortunately, I could not use the new unit with the old gear and shaft, and had to return it.  I also noticed some sloppiness in the new gear shaft fitment as compared to the used unit I needed to replace."
positive,The Rotors are very good and fit Perfectly and been driving with No Issues Brakes are smooth
positive,"I bought this and the Meguiar's one at the same time to try out two major competitors.  This one was super soft and kept soaking up water.  I was able to dry my wife's Cherokee without ringing out the towel.  The Meguiar's one I had to ring out 3 times for my Charger and felt scratchy.  I will see how this holds up over time.  So far, I like this one better and I am thinking about order another one or two.  My one complaint is that the tag is a little scratchy feeling and has to be folded out of the way."
negative,"This item is sturdy and the lock is secure.  But you must be sure that you have enough room for it on your vehicle.<br /><br />I ordered this intending to use it as a hitch lock on our motorhome...but it is so long, there is no room to use it.  It hits the body on both sides, due to the length, so it cannot be inserted from either side.  While the lock end needs to be lengthy, the other side did not need to be so big and that is where the problem was.  Maybe our hitch is not the same as some other motorhomes.<br /><br />I showed it to my husband and he tried to put it on our Jeep, but he ran into a similar problem.  The Jeep flat-4 electrical connector is mounted on one side of the hitch and it prevented him from pushing it in from that side, and if he slid it in from the other side, then there was no room for the lock end.<br /><br />It is designed for both 2"" and 2-1/2"" hitches, but the problem is that both ends are just too long.  If you have plenty of room, it would be a good lock.  We simply did not have enough room on our vehicles.  See pictures for the length.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because it does seem to be a very sturdy lock, just not for our vehicles."
positive,"Exactly what was needed for the deeper Zipp rims.  Removable valve core tubes and these extenders make everything so much easier.  I wish you could buy different lengths in a set, but this was a huge improvement.  48mm valves on the tubes and 60mm extensions fit the 808 rear wheel well but are long on the 404 front wheel."
positive,Great product
positive,They aren't super bright. But they replaced almost all the lights in my truck on a 2016 Colorado. And they seem brighter than the factory
positive,"Bought this to replace my OE equipment  and so far so good, seems to be as good as the Original"
positive,This item was missing from our 08 Tahoe and this fit perfectly.
positive,"Despite looking like nothing near what my old, broken, door switch looked like, it works just like the old one. Just a note, these are NOT that easy to replace if you have lost the wires within the car's metal interior."
negative,It’s new but not good
positive,Looks great and has maintained it color and quality through multiple car washes.
negative,"And the locking mechanism doesn't work, have to order OEM instead. Totally regret this purchase. Even the red stickers on the lock toggle is gummy and not even placed right. Save your money and GET OEM parts!!"
positive,Works great.
positive,Good value
positive,Great products.  This is a great kit for everything for your auto needs
positive,Fit perfectly
negative,"I bought this thinking that it would help me to do a brake job easier, product looks great, the idea is spot on, the problem is that mine didn’t hold a vacuum . I readjusted hides, fittings etc, and it doesn’t hold. Maybe I should have bought a more expensive version. Maybe it was just the 1 out of 100 that’s defective."
positive,Cartridge type*. Comes with 2 O rings one for the plug and one for the filter.
negative,"I know this is the genuine Toyota WS fluid for my Lexus RX400h CVT and rear motor/differential, but it just does not last long.  The WS fluid turns from cherry red to brown in the CVT and faded pink in the rear motor/diff in just 30K miles.  I expect better performance for a fluid this expensive.  The owner manual calls for just a visual check at 60K, or change at 60K if towing is involved.  I'd change it at every 30K.  Not impressed."
negative,"This stuff is so bad.<br />If you like streaks and spots, this is the washer fluid for you.<br />Terrible."
positive,Very easy to put up and take down. Fast delivery.
negative,"Be careful when installing.  Tail gates have cable supports that interfere with suggested mounting location.  This unit is minimal quality steel for support.  Any guys over 225lbs, should consider another make of access ladder. I find this unit minimal at best. Must also be on perfectly level ground when using or ladder twist considerably."
positive,Perfect fit and way better than the thin steel gasket that Nissan OEM supplied
negative,"Smell was great, but only lasted for two weeks. I was really anticipating it lasting longer. Kind of bummed."
negative,We had snow while I was out of town and the car was at the airport. As I was scraping the windshield the wiper arm broke away from the blade. The blade was embedded in the ice. Add you own invective.....
positive,Came packaged safely and on time.
negative,Product showed as ordered but did not work with the genie garage door opener.  Unfortunate actually because the size is perfect.
negative,I have change my review for this product. The color changed after only a couple months of use
positive,Bolted right on and only needed minor adjustments to properly tune in. Will buy again if needed
negative,truck stumbles when started up some times now - didn't do that before these were put on
positive,"Very nice fit on my 2003 gmc envoy sle.<br />Looks nice, no complaints yet will update if needed.<br />I noticed a slight pad dragging sound during the test drive, so I checked the inside of the old rotor and found that the parking brake pads had been dragging a little on the old rotor which was evident by the shiny smooth surface where the shoe was. Hopefully these stop otherwise I get to go back in and take the diff apart to get the axle out to replace the parking brake backing plate, which was almost completely gone. Thanks gmc, you made a 5 minute job into a 3 or more hour job. Brilliant."
positive,"Update:  Love it. Only need one band to secure. Nav, heart apps, music. :o)<br />*******************<br />Stays put  on the road. Don't know how it would be for off-road. Value for price. Confident it will hold my phone.  Does everything it's supposed to do. Does not cover headphone jack."
positive,They work well but are longer than they really say they are. Wanted to have them closer to the size they claimed. After measuring a tight measurement on my hitch but these are longer than they claimed and stick out more than I wanted. They do the job though.
negative,Item did not power on when connected to a verified power source.
negative,"When this is manufactured correctly it’s a very nice mirror. That said, I had to return two because the mechanism to swing the mirror about the bar was dysfunctional. It operates on two steel balls on springs and this part likely the depth of the holes the springs are in is not well quality controlled because two on them wouldn’t move if with loosing the screw. Then if it does come apart it is quite painful to put back together. Not a fan of this mechanism, especially in a mirror that is tremendously more expensive than others."
positive,"This AC adapter is more than what I needed, because of its choice of 7 voltages, which may be very useful to me in the future. I needed only one, and expected to pay for one, what I paid for the 7. Very good."
negative,Not a high quality product made by GM.  I am very disappointed with this product
positive,"Excellent kit. It is beautifully made, solid brass. The magnet (that gets a slight mention in the product description) locks this down so tight that I would bet it could survive a hurricane - stuck like glue to the side of an air conditioner.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is not much you can say about this - easy to connect, easy to clean and easy to use. Weighty - compared to lesser models, but that is testament to its quality.<br />The cap on the side which is equally well made (unscrewing and screwing it back - it tightens in the thread towards the end, cannot be (easily) over tightened, and its clear when its sealed) is held in place when removed by a handy rubber line.<br /><br />Costs more than many, but quality tools last forever! This is a solid investment"
positive,"seems to be working, ended up having to replace my water pump so I don't know if I really needed it."
negative,Not enough product on the sponge and it really didn't do much for my car.
positive,These worked and were at a good price
positive,Great Product!
positive,Fit and works as expected.
positive,Works great for my 1999 F150 5.4L. This can solve the common lean condition code besides a dirty mass airflow sensor which can throw the same code on my truck.
positive,Smells good but did not work well on stains. Definitely will not purchase this again as other products I have used worked better.
positive,Good product as advertised
positive,I love these mats. They have cut down on the amount of dirt and water transferred from my kids shoes to the backs of my seats. It has spared my leather seats from normal wear and tear. these were easy to install both for my rear facing daughter and my forward facing son in the van. I should have purchased these a long time ago.
positive,Took a little time to line up the holes.  Fits nicely on a 19 year old S10.
positive,Very nice and sturdy key holder looks just like the pic
positive,works good
positive,"This is a high quality coolant. It works as described for my car and it’s easy to use. It’s a very straightforward product, but it’s reassuring to know that it works as anticipated. Five stars."
positive,Only used one time and so far they work really well easy installation and wipe clean leaving no streaks.
positive,They work!! I had to insert abd remove 12 times not 6
positive,"Used three, worked, will change my mind if they go, but the price beats one at my local hardware store so 1:6..six wins."
positive,Excellent
positive,I mounted these on all sides of my tractor and was amazed how much light they produce. they don't get knocked of like other lights I have used
positive,Great!
positive,"I have an existing Klein direct drive air horn, but the tone was much higher then I wanted. The longer trumpet gives a nice deep sound. It’s not all that much louder then the factory horn on a superduty truck, but if you need a air horn it’s a great inexpensive choice."
positive,Great replacement parts
negative,"I have yet been unable to install. I have asked for help on why the side bolts don't fit and I haven't received a straight answer. Upon looking at previous comments/reviews, I read someone used an M12 Thread wrench. I went ahead and bought that and tried it, it went in the car's hole, but the bolts provided are still not going in. My husband already went to Ace Hardware and got more bolts and those didn't work either. This has resulted in multiple arguments on about different possibilities as to why this is not fitting. Now I am considering purchasing more bolts, which would be the third set of bolts we purchase for this. Now, if they had sent the correct bolts in the beginning, we wouldn't be having this conversation.<br /><br />I see other buyers have had a problem with the bolts as well. Had I paid attention to them, I would have not purchased this hitch. It's too expensive to return and now I am stuck trying to either resell this hitch, keep purchasing bolts, or just seriously put it in the trash. The headache this has caused is nauseating.<br /><br />So far, I have spent multiple trips to the hardware store to buy different sets of bolts, the thread wrench, and much time trying to get this installed. Factor all that in, it would have been more cost effective, less stressful, and less time consuming had I just gone to Uhaul. Ugh."
positive,"So far I really like this car cover. My new car was getting covered with tree sap from the sick tree next to the neighbor's driveway, and this takes care of that issue completely. When I ordered it, I took the advice of another reviewer and purchased one size larger than what the seller recommended for my car and that has worked out perfectly. I'm glad I did that. I live near a large body of water so the wind is pretty much a daily challenge, but this car cover has elastic all the way around the bottom so it stays put no matter how high the wind blows; I don't even have to use the straps to anchor it to the car it works so good. My only issue with the car cover is the same as with any car cover, it is a five minute painful process of running back and forth around the car to get it rolled/unrolled. If someone has a good technique for doing that quickly, I'd love to hear about it! I did not receive any compensation or discount for my review, I just wanted to let folks know that this car cover is well made and well worth the price!"
positive,Audi A4 protected from day 1 -- carpet still like new. Easy to remove and scrub outside of car. No worries about muddy or snow-packed shoes or boots ruining your car.
positive,now I charge my car with this everyday and take only f couple of hours to make it full
positive,"Looks cool but has a much higher profile above my head than I was hoping so it looks a bit more dopey than cool...  I thought oils ride closer to my he'd on top...  That being said, it is DOT, and the leather look is very cool.  I just need to find a center spike now to draw away from the height...  Overall decent helmet."
positive,"This was a perfect replacement on my 2014 Tacoma.  Took about 10 minutes with a Torx T30 bit in my drill and a 10mm socket.  I have the backup camera and it installed flawlessly.  I didn't have to bend or turn or switch anything around, it was a direct replacement for the stock tailgate handle/lever.  So this may be a new improved version.  Love how the BOLT technology codes your key to the lock on the first turn of the lock!"
positive,"Have not installed it yet, but if it doesn't leak, it will be great! Great price & really fast delivery"
positive,Fit my Pilot and works great.
positive,Works perfectly. Lawnmower starts faster now
positive,"Convert a ball is best produce going and the service from manufacturer is unsurpassed. Have several shafts and move them around, theses covers will keep them clean"
positive,"For the cost you absolutely can’t go wrong.  Who would have guessed a stylish trash can would exist?  lol.  Seriously, it’s very functional, large enough for a normal use, and the strap/mounting has different options depending on your use.  It’s actually very well built.  This was a a very good purchase and a surprise given the price.  I work out of my vehicle all day.  I don’t put half full sodas in it and can’t say it’s completely waterproof, but I’m sure it is.  The insert is something like in a cooler.  You can’t go wrong with this.  This is one if the Best Buy’s I’ve had on Amazon in a while."
positive,Exactly what I needed. Fast delivery.
positive,The only issue I had is I think it’s a bit pricey. Otherwise it’s sturdy and great looking. Just perfect!
positive,"well done, smooth cuts, easy to put on, came out looking great on my car and would buy others."
positive,"Works fine, cheaper than buying at the truck stop."
positive,I had to change it in a one year
negative,"You must really want to put these on if Lippert did not install mounting plates at the factory. This is not a project for a novice mechanic. Ordered two at the same time. Both were missing parts and both had the wrong parts. Instructions can be found online with a simple search. . A few $100 bucks to get a welder to fabricate top mounting plates to offset from H bean and slideout roll bar. Also, you will have to cut out a piece of the bottom plate if you have Trailer SumoSprings installed."
positive,Nice scent
positive,Handy tool
negative,"This alternator fit perfectly, it's still working fine. BUT the price dropped over $5 just after I bought it. Why don't I get a refund??"
positive,Worked Great foe me. Used these to keep mud and snow off the running boards on my truck.
positive,works easy on cab over tie down
negative,Power steering pump arrived without nuts and bolts. When we had it placed in an automobile it did not work. It was returned
positive,"So pretty, fit perfectly and was easy to put on.  My car is a 2017.5 Murado."
negative,"As the item description states, “this will fit your 2018 fusion”. No, it does not. Not only is the backseat floor mat not long enough to fit, but the center part is too wide. Doesn’t come close to laying flat or covering the floor."
positive,This works great.
negative,"They are not great, water leaks out, the gatorade bottles with the automatic stopper are a lot better of a product, one of the stoppers came out of the bottle as well. Not great, would not order again. Again, they leak and the automatic stoppers are better."
positive,"Unlike many other brands, this one is big enough to put on."
positive,This bike net holder works really well.  It expands but is not going to loosen up like most nets do after awhile.  This one is very sturdy and does a good job of holding things on my bike rack. Good deal for the product.
positive,"I haven't used it, but the size, heft and appearance of the can inspires confidence.  I switched from run flats to non run flat tires on my car and I have no way to carry a spare.  I bought this, another brand of a similar product, a set of tire plugs, an air compressor and a scissor jack - all of which I keep in my trunk.  If I were to have a puncture, this can is the first thing I would try, should I find myself inconveniently far away from the promise of roadside assistance."
positive,I love it!!
positive,Obviously I just received the tire kit so I can’t attest to how it performs. But it’s all really good quality and will fit my 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe. It even fits in the storage space in the trunk once you take out the storage divider that’s in there. My cat is also a fan
negative,Item runs small and not wide enough for husbands wide feet. The material is stiff and has no give.
positive,Fits my husbands 2007  MX-5 perfectly.
positive,Sons birthday gift
positive,does the job and nice to have around when you need it.
positive,"Made the warning light go off, after replacing this.  2006 Sienna Van."
positive,"This will hold about a full pack of cigarette butts before you have to empty it. If it's getting full, a cigarette butt might not fall into the hole, but if you shake the can a little to settle the butts in the bottom, you get more mileage out of it."
negative,The item did not work on my car.  The screw holes for my power lock were in the wrong place.  I ended up returning item.  Return was very easy.
positive,"My husband and I bought these helmets at Christmas. He was admittedly a little skeptical that they would work as well as advertised (he expected a lot of wind noise interference and thought they'd be as unreliable as the walkie-talkies of his youth) but we decided to try them. Wow, was he glad to be wrong!<br /><br />These helmets made our bicycling trips so much more enjoyable. We can chat while we're riding without having to raise our voices or turn our heads. Wind noise is a rarity and even then, it's not bad enough to overpower our normal speaking voices.<br /><br />Dropped connections are rare and quickly remedied by touching a button on the side of the helmet. The helmets stay in contact for at least half a mile, according to our armature tests.<br /><br /> The battery life is surprisingly long. We got a warning his helmet had low battery but we were able to complete our 14 mile ride without it going dead.<br /><br />We're really glad we bought these and they've made our rides much more enjoyable and companionable."
positive,Perfect replacement turn signal lamp for my 2002 Tacoma
positive,2018 Ram 1500 Regular cab Express. Mats seem very durable with great coverage and they are easy to clean. However I’m not 100% satisfied with the fit on the driver’s side - more like 90% satisfied since the right edge of the liner doesn’t follow the contour of the center hump perfectly. A slight bulge that wouldn’t bother most people. Anyone else wouldn’t probably even notice it. Husky had sent me a replacement and still the same issue.
positive,awesome
positive,"I absolutely love this item. I recently purchased my 2nd vehicle, for economic reasons, and my children wanted it to be black. I searched auto stores for plates that I may like instead of the advertised dealership plates, I found none that interested me. I logged into Amazon, for further research for a great vehicle plate, and found several yet choose; Bling plates in black. I placed my order for 2 day shipping, along with 2 other items, and as promised, received my order on time! I love my Bling plates and I'm about to place another order for the silver Bling plates for my SUV.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for delivering as promised.<br />Lady B."
positive,Part arrived quickly and cit great!!
negative,the cargo net that was sent and the one pictured are 2 different kinds.  the one shown is to help keep items from rolling out when opening the hatch.  The one sent is designed to hang on the back ot the seats to hold items.  Cost to return is not worth them time.  Please don't use stock pictures but the actual item.
positive,"This was easy to install and fits perfect. It was shipped in a box with the hardware and instructions. Lubricated the existing bolt holes with penetration oil and torqued in steps to 60 Ft-Lb, then 70 Ft-Lb. Spec says to go to 86 Ft-Lb, but I'm going to wait a few days for the oil to ooze off before applying final torque."
positive,Got this to keep in my old Passat wagon.
positive,I can highly recommend this seller and the key chain. I bought this key chain for my picky husband and expected the usual rejection - he LOVES it. Sturdy and easy to use. A++
positive,Nothing works great had have it modified for my trailer. But it was good material to work with.
negative,I didn't notice that the clip doesn't turn around. My vents are side ways not up and down so my red lips are side ways. I don't smell the scent even if I touch it. I'm not complaining because I only bought it for the color but it would have been nice if it was up right.
positive,I wasn't sure that these would fit my 2008 Ford F-450 but they did. Look great and fit perfectly.
negative,Dies not stay in place wish I had returned them.
positive,"I love the quality, soft and I can wipe it just with a wet towel, easy to put in but no out, I was trying to try another cases that I bought but I couldn’t do it, the rubber is really estick to my control ☺️"
negative,Poor quality and thick insert edges make window closing harder
positive,Just what I needed to direct airflow higher on my helmet.
positive,Sticks very well.  It’s on my iPad.
positive,"This is a good product without unnecessary costs.  This is how other auto parts should be available to buy, without entire units at huge expense."
positive,easy to use
positive,"In our 2008 silverado the passenger window would not roll down from the main switch. We replaced the window master switch with this one and it fixed the issue! It matched the other OEM lights extremely closely.. i was a little worried about it, but they honestly match. It looks and works great!"
positive,"What can you say it's an ashtray.  Does what it's suppose to do.  I use snuffers to put out my cigs so I don't get the burn marks in the bottom of the ashtray as others reviewers have mentioned, but it's only been a little less than 2 weeks since I've received them.  We use them outside on the deck. They are also a nice size.The ashtray works great for what it's intended for - to dump your ashes in and put out your cigs.  If you are looking for anything more than a plain ashtray that works-this ain't for you."
positive,Love this product! 2nd time purchasing.<br />Leaves my car so shiny!
positive,"No strong perfume odor and it works to eliminate odors, but seems to wear away quickly.<br />My house is very clean, but I have a dog who although is bathed frequently still has a 'dog odor' and this helped eliminate that."
positive,Perfect
negative,"I don't like the fact that in order to utilize the built-in amp, you have to only utilize the two front channels, getting rid of any rear channel or fading abilities.  I have a Chrysler 300, 2006 premium sound."
positive,Does what I wanted it to do...cover scratches.
positive,"I just installed this kit on my 2011 Ford F150 Super Crew Pick Up. Great product, great customer service from Air Lift. Was missing the right hand upper attaching bracket. (I received 2 left hand brackets) Contacted Mike at Air Lift and he could not have been nicer. He shipped 2nd Day UPS the missing bracket to my location. The instruction manual is pretty much straight forward as to how to go about installing. It took me longer than most to get the kit on because I am a perfectionist! :) Works Great!"
positive,"Not bad it’s still working, decent product but it is kinda small though just needs to be alittle bigger but still good"
positive,Good
positive,"Look great. Good quality. Fit is fine. Installed fairly easily, Problem was due to limited space inside car. Somewhat pricy, but quality offsets that negative."
positive,"I love this windshield shade! It fits perfectly in my Jeep Cherokee Latitude.  Based on some of the reviews,  I was slightly concerned that it wouldn’t - I’ve had no issues."
positive,It works just fine.
positive,Nice collection of tools for car washing with a pressure washer. Various adapters included means it'll work with most any presser washer. The spinning brush is great for general body washing ( very soft bristles) and several other useful attachments. Recomended.
positive,excellent product will buy again when needed
positive,Installed on my 72 Grand Prix to replace 47 year old original hose`s Fit was good.
positive,"Large, very stable, easy to set up. Plastic box contains 3. Easy to store in trunk of car without taking up a lot of space."
positive,Simple. There really isn't anyway to mess this up. Works perfectly and is great to just leave it on the battery and forget about it.
positive,As described
positive,"If your a guy or girl that can change a tire in this day...this is a great kit. I have twice personally pulled a tire with a nail, removed it (plyers  and portable air pump required), did the patch and was rolling again in no time..."
negative,Verify pan depth as well 4x4s have draper pans so the pumps need to be larger.
positive,Just what I needed.
positive,Easy to install. Just got today so can’t rate durability but I love it. Going to buy a second one for my spare key my husband uses.
positive,Works good.
negative,Once dirty forget about it
positive,"fit perfectly and I installed it myself (a senior woman)  SIMPLE  and it works great.  I'd recommend it to my friends...if they have a mini.  It was a little hard to find, but we finally made it"
positive,Very cool product! I gave these as a gift to my car enthusiast husband and he was very pleased with the variety of products. I will definitely come back and buy more of these in the future!
positive,Item as described.
positive,"I ordered this through Libra Trailer Parts and it was quickly shipped, but due to UPS losing it and after checking the tracking thru UPS I contacted Libra to let them know UPS had basically lost the item in Memphis Tn. Libra replied within 2 days and quickly shipped out another one which was delivered soon and in good condition. So Kudo's to Libra for taking care of UPS's loss of the item, Also this is an EXCELLENT WELL MADE PRODUCT that I'm already using. AAA+++ All The Way!!!!!"
positive,A great quote from a great man! the bumper sticker is easy to apply and is easy to clean - though it doesn't really get very dirty by either dust or dirt.<br /><br />Jai Ho!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001SBU39I We Must Be The Change We Wish To See In the World. -Bumper Sticker]]
positive,"Installed on a Triumph Thunderbird; took about three minutes .<br />Sturdy , easily mounted and roomy ."
positive,Good
positive,"I have not put these in yet, though Im sure they will be fine. My 1st order of these was thrown in w/ my shoe order! Just rolling around in box loose! They arrived w/ broken pkg & a bulb loose in box. They sent a replacement asap & it was in its own box & in perfect cond.!<br />Its just a pain RETURNING the old ones, uhhh. But , I will update how ""white"" these are: I have a 2009 Mercedes C class .  :)"
positive, 
negative,"looks awesome, installs in under a minute, but reception is MUCH worse. great antenna for someone that uses ipod or Bluetooth radio hahaha"
negative,"Purchased these to replace the links on a 2002 CR-V with over 200,000 miles on it. The old ones have been making some noise for a while now.<br />They were relatively easy to change, I would recommend spraying some penetrate oil on them to help them loosen up as the threads would likely be rusted. Also, keep a torch handy as when one side was almost off the nut got stuck on the last few threads.<br /><br />Install is easy, though I have 1 gripe with these new links. On top of the serrated locking flange nuts, they attempted to make the nut tension locking but ended up destroying the nut in the process. They crushed the nut so that you can no longer put a socket or the boxed end of the wrench on it. The nut was badly out of round. With the position of the Control arm mounting point of the link it would be impossible to tighten with out using the allen key to turn the stud, which is not the proper way of tightening it as you can cause the link to prematurely fail if you turn the stud too much.<br />I ended up reusing the old OEM nuts and had no issues.<br />I had this issue with both this part and the opposite side (45G0333)<br />Next time I will not buy link kits from ACDelco."
positive,fits perfect
positive,Easy to apply....looks great
negative,"Description said it would work for my 2010 Equinox.  Well, I paid to have it cut & found out it would not program !!  Was told the numbers do not match, therefore, it’s worthless now.  Sending back."
positive,Used for my 2019 Ranger CP 1000. Everything works as it should.
positive,Nice compact kit with good locking lid for the fuse case. The included inline fuse holders are awesome as everything you wire should have these installed.
positive,I love this product. Easy to use and it Works
negative,"Not cut right to fit well, bottom holes didn't line up at all and had to be redrilled, clips don't fit in holes at all (except the ONE clip that slides over the metal- others that go in holes is stupid).<br />Took 1 hour to get ONE on.  I will have to drive around with one on for now because what should have been a 20 min job took too long and it got dark."
negative,"The bag is great the buckles snapped the very first install. I bought some harbor freight 2 in tie-down straps. I cut off the buckles and used them.  solid metal and holds the bag to the spare well.  see photo. the black plastic buckles are totally not even worth trying to install. The bag is great, did a 5500 mile Overlanding trip this summer and the bag was terrific. the bag did not stay black in the desert in summer but the dust came right off. All the reviews seem to say the same thing: great bag garbage buckles. BELIEVE the reviews."
positive,Looks awesome
positive,did a pretty decent job on clearing up my headlights- manually.  will recommend to others!
positive,Perfect fit on my 2002 330ci.  Easy to swap out the old with the new.
positive,Worked great for the koney
positive,Perfect machine that my son in law needed
positive,Works as expected. Had no problems after a few months of use
positive,"Great for the price, my only issue was, when fully tightened, the bolts stick out too far and scrape your knuckles. I replaced em with some m4-0.7 x 16mm socket head bolts and they're perfect."
positive,Looks great on the golf cart. So glad I got the tinted windshield.
positive,Very fast shipping and as described thank you.
negative,Product works fine just took forever to receive
positive,The shell is very basic but completely functional.  I had the blank cut at Ace Hardware for $40 and this key is in operation now with no problems.  The L for Lexus would have been a nice touch but this works.
positive,Works well. Fits fine.
positive,Does the job. Simple install but the instructions help a lot too. Towed all over the south east with this mount and it's even helped me get unstuck from the mud. Would recommend curt over Reese any day. Looks great and the paint has held up too for those who worry about that.
negative,Even if you manage to put it together the buttons don’t even work. I officially broke my original car key so I can’t return this one. The only button that works is the panic. Waste of money. Don’t even bother
negative,this product does not fit a 2010 tundra at all especially in the front
positive,"Cheap, but it works..."
negative,Had to return.  Was no use to us.
positive,"So far so good. Fits my 93 YJ like a glove. Nice, tight fit."
positive,Easy to install. Fits better than the one prior. Great item. Buy and you won’t be disappointed.
positive,"Super cool lighter.  No flame, works a little slower than flame but super cool.  Charge it rather than maintaining your butane habit!"
positive,easy install and very high quality!
positive,"These are nice looking and sturdy.  They do exactly what the are designed to do.  Until seat belts are better designed, these solve the problem of uncomfortable rubbing of your neck while in the car."
positive,My car was a good choice to work on Murano.
positive,Thissun shade works very well and fits perfectly.  C-Max has a very large front window so the shade is very large an d sometime unwieldy
positive,cleans carpet and smells good
positive,Perfect replacement on the 2004 350Z.  Very easy install.
positive,Seems sharp enough and good grip on handle. I can't believe one could shatter glass with the dinky thing. Sheath and Velcro are perfect to attach to Jeep rollbar.
negative,it works
positive,"Bought these for my 02 Intrigue after I started hearing the upper mount clunk noise, I have replaced just the mount before. With 225,000 and original spring and strut I thought I would splurge. The fit was good. One of the strut mounts was clocked a little off so I had to twist hard to align with knuckle."
negative,Disappointed in these. Was expecting them to be noticeably brighter than the OEM...they are NOT.
positive,"Great product, installed and working well. Can't say much more other than would definitely buy this again if I needed one."
positive,"Ok I want a tire gel that has a wet look, lasts a long time and most importantly does not sling off when driving.  This Meguiar's product meets all of the requirements well.  I apply with a foam applicator.  Just put the product on the foam applicator and just wipe it on, it is pretty thick and it goes on easily.  I roll the car to cover everything evenly and that is it.  No wiping off necessary.  Typically I drive right away after applying and I have no sling on the car.  If it is does not rain on me, I can wash my car again and not need to reapply the gel so I will just wash the wheels and leave the tire.  Of course if you want max shine every time, just reapply.  Love this product."
positive,This is literally one of the coolest inventions ever. So simple yet effective. I bought another for my husbands truck so we each have one when we tow the boat. I dont know how I lived without it!
positive,"looks great and easy to install.  Keep your top on, remove the sound bar.  Really adds a nice touch to the interior."
positive,just as expected
positive,"I was afraid to use this on my Mercedes, but I’m glad I did, it made the dull leather come<br />Back to life!"
negative,"basically this is a slightly thinner silicone glue than normal.  It would not flow into cracks or crevices in a bulls-eye chip.  I don't know if I got a tube from a bad batch or what, but I wouldn't buy it again."
positive,Perfect
positive,"I like the fact that these come with a thick steel pin to use as an extra safety. The 6 ton jack stands will hold 12,000 lbs. when used together as a pair. The manual states this on the front cover. They are built solid and finished nicely with thick corrosion resistant paint. I trust these jack stands."
negative,It cover up things if thats what you want it to do.
positive,I bought this one hoping it would hold up better 5han my last one. This looks to have very sturdy construction soy hopes are high for it.
positive,Looks and fits great.
positive,Very good
positive,"NICE COVER! It fit perfectly on my Yamaha Silverado. Heavy weight material, well constructed. I like the elastic on the bottom so that the cover hugs the bike. This was a very good deal and I highly recommend this to everyone."
positive,Good size. Read the directions on line.
positive,"Decent quality and easy install. Awesome for in the trunk and on the courtesy lights on the door. In my opinion far to bright for the inside of a car, though. Also, small amounts of light stay on at all times unless you completely cut power to them. Barely noticeable."
positive,Really like these seat covers but hard to put on. And they can snag easy.
positive,Fit perfect little oil to make it easy and voila popped right together.<br />Thanks Edelbrock great product.  :-)
positive,"I plan on using this tire as a spare, so I'll update performance when I need to use it.<br /><br />I bought a 35x12.5x17, and it came with red letters.  Apparently not all sizes come with the red letters yet.  Verify the red lettering by going to generaltire.com and look at the X3 full specifications.  If the sidewall says, SRL, it has red letters.<br /><br />With that said, my 35"" tire isn't quite 35"".  It's more of 34.6"".  The lugs are aggressive and I expect it to do well off the pavement."
positive,Slick and well made.
positive,"Be sure to clean the connections when you swap TPS sensor, sometimes the connections is all the problem. As for the unit, it works great and saved some bucks over local shops."
positive,"these are great pads to go along with my Porter cable variable polisher buffer,,,, they have seven different pads depending on what you are trying to do with your car paint, or van SUV RV or your boat,,,,,"
positive,"Great great deal, 2019 ram 1500 they’re excellent."
positive,Looks great on my son’s 370Z
positive,"best joke we played on our daughter, fell apart over time"
positive,I really love the way that they look on my vehicle.  It was easy to install
negative,DIDN''T WORK
positive,[[VIDEOID:7df99baff18807b3e4ac539308362336]] I purchased these after a YouTube video showed these do not hyper flash. I went with the purchase on Amazon because they had the lowest price. Installed in less than ten minutes front and back. They are bright and hopefully get the attention of drivers.<br /><br />I will add I did amber front not the white and amber because I feel the color amber catches people’s eyes more than white. But that’s my opinion. So far they’re great.
positive,"The brush guard itself is fine, but certainly not heavy duty. There is some side to side play no matter how much ive tried to tighten the bolts. It was also difficult to secure it to the frame, as some of the bolts that came with the kit stripped rather easily. It looks good and hopefully will protect my truck from the inevitable deer impact"
positive,Made the ride smooth and install was very easy. Very nice shocks for the money. I will buy these again when I need shocks.
positive,"Perfict fit, saved big pucks doing myself."
positive,"Installing tint is a professional task. It looks so easy when I watch the pros tint my car, so I wanted to save money. Bought this ceramic tint, tint application tool kit, and did my research on YouTube. Then set to the task. But, the tint itself can't do the job for you. The skills of the pros come from years of practice."
positive,it works
positive,They were exactly what i needed.  Worked perfectly.
positive,Used in our RV to keep food and drinks for moving while traveling.
positive,Have only used it once but worked great
positive,Had to return due to my truck did not have this unit installed in it.
positive,"I have a board that runs along the eave of a office building I had built behind my house. One end of this board became rotted and replacing this long board would be quite a chore. I purchased two cans of this putty to use for this repair and some others. The cans arrived all dented rather severely but the contents appear to be usable. The first repair is rather deep so I had to repair in layers. I would mix a batch with the hardener that was provided under a plastic cap on the can. The drying process was very fast and with three applications I was able to fill the gap, After allowing more than ample time for drying I sanded the repair and applied a coat of paint. So far, so good."
positive,"I'm a sucker for a red container, but also, this is great motor oil. I use it in my WRX because it's a high performance machine. Is it cheap? No. Does it work awesome? Yes."
positive,great sticker for my Waverunners
positive,"I'm very impressed. I've always been buying the EBC rotors and Red Crap and Green Crap etc, hands down these are way better. OK I'm in the Austin area so it's hot and not too wet. But these rotors have been on for about a month now and I've washed the car and they still shine and rotors have no rust. I have 90% less brake dust compare to the EBC pads. I like the price I like the quality and if you are using EBC red or green I'd recommend these rotors and pads over them anytime. Do prep the pads after you put them on like the instructions as you to do so."
positive,Works great and is very bright.
positive,Quality item
positive,Much needed for my 1.8t Passat.  genuine VW parts. fit my 2002 easy install.
positive,2019 tacoma double cab. Used in the front bed bolts. Increased the bolt size hole to 1/2 inch. Was a pain to get the bolt out so used an impact drive at my local mechanic. Well built.
positive,"This was an exact replacement for the curtain hold down in my RV. Just like the original, they are plastic so they will break just as easy<br /><br />1. Easy to install.<br />2. Direct replacement"
positive,a versatile product. what a timesaver. excellent product.
positive,Gives you more confident while changing the lanes
positive,So far its been doing its job.  We’ll see in a few months how it holds up.  Using it on my 2005 Ram 2500 Quad Cab (4-door)
positive,Happy
positive,Just arrived and installed today on 2010 Camaro RS. All you need is a T20 bit. 3 screws inside each wheelwell allow access to bulbs from behind the fog light/ DRL assembly. I went to 3 parts stores and was sold the wrong bulbs 3 times. Found these in 5 minutes on Amazon. They appear much more white and about 50%+ brighter. Cant speak to longevity yet. Install took less than 15 min. Turn front wheels away from the side you're working on for the most access.
positive,"The best sticker I have ever gotten! I got it about a year ago, and my laptop continues to show people that it is my swamp. It is an immediate conversation starter. I bought a matching DONKEH sticker and they prove to my peers that I am truly a swamp queen."
positive,These were easy to install and appear to be held securely in place.  These should do well to keep bugs from building nests in the vents.
positive,"Great price, very fast shipping. A+++"
positive,Does a great job cleaning my dirty filters.
positive,"Same as my old Bauer gloves that have lasted me a good almost 3 years before the stitching started to go. After the years I felt it ok to buy a new glove. I'm sure the old ones have their fair share of bacteria built up, or I would've considered just patching them. No complaints here. Fingers more easily, fits same as my old 14's did and doesn't smell... For now."
positive,"This thing works very well!  Put the additive in the tank, fill with water, and you have a flushing toilet perfect for camping!  It's fairly light weight, too!"
positive,"Great replacement for the original safety spouts with plastic parts and springs that constantly break and need to be reassembled. Spout does causes some 'glugging' and I think it is from the strainer holding up to much flow , but it is so much better than the cheap contraptions that come with many gas cans that it is well worth the switch. The end cap screws on securely to prevent spills and leaks while being stored."
positive,Great
positive,Works great. Love the attachments. Cord is a good length. Excellent for tubing and camping!
positive,"Why I like this relay better than the other ones on Amazon (and better than the more intelligent Battery Brain it replaced):<br /><br />1) Requires an SPDT switch rather than a full-blown reversing (DPDT criss-cross) switch.  Only 3 wires to switch because the relay has two separate coils for on and off.<br />2) Built-in fuse holders (2 of them, switched and unswitched).  Having these built-in eliminates the need for one more dangling in-line  component.<br />3) Works even at low voltage (worked fine below 10V).  This is important if your battery is half-dead.<br /><br />Downsides:<br />1) It's fairly large.  I can't complain, there is plenty of space in a RAM 2500.<br />2) Only 300A max current.  This is not enough for a starter on a big truck, but then again it is best to leave the starter directly connected and use the relay for everything else.  Most vehicles make this fairly easy - I bought https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003RCJB62/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 (hookup cables) so I wouldn't have to improvise, and aside for soldering the switch (I had a momentary SPDT laying around) it was plug and play.<br /><br />Wiring notes (for those that are having trouble) can be found here: [...] but should be fairly obvious.  The diagram is confusing because for most installations, you'll be using the battery side (blue) as the switch source (blue dotted line explains that but is easy to miss).  I added a modified diagram that eliminates the confusion (note: you still need body ground on the mounting brackets)"
positive,Good
positive,Excellent product.  Lasts a week.  Best with a legit tire sponge applicator.
positive,Don’t drop and drive! Nuff said👍
positive,"Sturdy flag, great magnet and it looks great on my Jeep and my husbands truck."
positive,great product
positive,Bought for riding mower.
positive,"I never thought I would find replacement wipers for my boat. These fit like a charm and do a great job. The first trip of the season found us in 3-4 foot seas and, although the trip was rough, I could see perfectly."
positive,I wasn't sure if this Raptor-style grill was going to be good quality but I decided to take chance and I'm glad I did. My order went very well...except for one thing - no instructions. I'm fortunate that I can work on my own cars/trucks but I also found a handy YouTube video to help expedite the installation. I just hope the plastic doesn't fade over time and continues to look great for years to come!
positive,Nice curved blade design. Hugs the windshield even in windy conditions.  Nice clean swipe with no streaks or skips.  Easy to install.  Blade material seems durable.  Not sure if this wiper will be any good in the snow and ice but I dont think it really is meant for winter use.  I got this in exchange for my honest review
negative,"Like many of you, I purchased this with the intent of retrofitting H9 bulbs to an H11 harness. The point of buying the extension was to modify it to remove a step in modifying H9 bulbs and add a little security between the hotter bulbs and factory harnesses. These cables are well made and the plug is truly ceramic... but that means you cannot remove the sliver of material on the plug that differentiates the two types of bulbs. I ended up returning these and ordered the plastic version.<br /><br />If you just need an H11 extension, it doesn't get much better than this. If you are using for a retrofit, avoid the ceramic plug."
positive,"Looks great , with good quality too, for the price. I would buy again"
positive,"Third time purchasing, every year I replace them. Work great, ready install."
positive,"I have to say I am incredibly impressed with these mats, especially at this price point. We recently purchased two new front mats and they were over twice the price. They were custom to the make of my husband's car, they quality was not anywhere near as impressive. These mats are far thicker and feel like they are made out of much nicer materials. And these mats stay put too. They were really easy to trim down as well. I don't think it took me more than 10 minutes to get all three mats perfectly sized and installed. I'd recommend these in a heartbeat."
positive,"228,000 miles and for that least 20,000 no heated seat for the driver due to deterioration of the seat.  This solved the problem!"
positive,Great product
positive,"Here is a before/after install comparison. Install was tedious but once I figured out how to remove the halogens without breaking the side clips, it was a breeze. I use light covers on each side so the rear camera doesn't get blurred with brightness. I love the whiter light as opposed to the dull yellow color."
positive,"The sleeve is a bit too short though, meaning there could be clicking noise under situations where sideways body roll occur.<br /><br />The bolt is unlikely to seized in here as the sleeve diameter about 4mm bigger.<br /><br />A mechanic charged me $60 for this, and a local auto parts store wanted $40!"
positive,"I already had the battery from another Sun Joe tool, so I only needed the inflator. I have a Diehard a compressor that is great, but so heavy to carry around and needs to be threaded on to the tire. The Sun Joe is lightweight and clamps on the tire and so much easier to use. I’m going to be buying more as gifts"
positive,Great replacement buttons for atv fenders
positive,"This is a very handy device to keep in your car to deal with the inevitable need for keep your tires properly inflated. It's very compact - fits very easily in the trunk or in the back seat foot well. Everything stores neatly in the unit. Easy to use - just set the dial to the desired pressure and plug it in, either via an extension cord, or using a power port in the car. It shuts off automatically when the target pressure is reached.<br /><br />It's pretty accurate, but you'll want to check your tires with a proper gauge to make sure the pressure is where it should be. So, if you need (for example) 33 lbs, set the B&D for 35. When it shuts off, check it with the gauge and (if necessary) bleed off any excess.<br /><br />It's a bit noisy, but no more than other similar products in this price range. Build quality seems pretty good. I had a similar model from another manufacturer that only lasted about a year. The B&D product seems far more sturdy, and I'm hoping it will last. Had it for three months, and so far, so good. The two-year warranty is nice just in case.<br /><br />It's not a replacement for a compressor. I have a small one in the garage, and use that when I'm home to inflate tires. But, when you're on the road, this can be a godsend, especially if you get a flat and find that the spare tire is very low on air (yes, I know I should check that regularly, but never seem to remember). Having the Air Station in the car is a lot easier than trying to find a gas station when you need air. Also very handy to have for bike tires.<br /><br />The price fluxuates quite a bit - if you get it at a price dip it's well worth the price."
positive,Not bad
positive,Ended up not using them
positive,"This works for me. I usually oil the locks around my house once a year - using [[ASIN:B0083V8LPO 3-IN-ONE Multi-Purpose Oil]]. So I was happy to get a sample can of this aerosol version. It worked just as well and was easier to apply. I used it on more than just locks - I also sprayed all the hinges on the outside of my house. If you got a outside lock (or a hinge) I would recommend either style product.<br /><br />I did have an issue with the little red straw that comes with the can. It comes attached to the can with a piece of tape - after detaching (and using the product) I wrapped a rubber-band around the can and used that to secure the straw during storage. I should mention that I lost the straw for awhile (took me forever to find it). I had just sprayed the lock on one of the outside burglar-bars on the back of my house and the straw had disappeared. Thinking it had just fell out of the nozzle I searched the ground & grass under the window. Five minutes of searching and no straw to be found. Eventually found it, long-story short, when I was spraying the lock the straw came loose and was propelled by the oil and the straw was shot about 20 feet away. I mention this as I'm probably not the only person that's happen to."
positive,"Handy stuff, works well. Sturdy too.<br />Like other users suggest, practicing using it a few times before actually applying can make things a lot easier. An empty cardboard box is easy to practice on and discard. Do wish it mixed more simply like a 1 to 1 or 2 to 1 ratio of filler to hardener, but it's no big deal - it's not hard, just takes getting used to - get nervous until I get the feel of working with it.<br />Anyhow still great stuff, will be using this a lot, for projects too not just for repairs."
positive,I put these as my tailgate latches in hopes they would work and heck yeah they did!!!!! I drive a 1988 f150 so you have reference as to what you’re trying to fit these to.
positive,"Time will tell if it does what it's supposed to do, but so far, so good on multiple motorcycle batteries."
positive,"Very high quality, solid metal construction. I'm impressed at this price point. It's a third of the price of the top third party brands, which cost even more for the locks. I wouldn't be surprised if these were made in the same factory as the Honda brand cross bars. The only negative is that the screws and washers didn't seem as high quality as the cossbars, though Im confident they'll hold up well. I do worry about how easily they could be removed, but I'm not sure the locks on the top brand crossbars are actually that effective either against a motivated thief."
positive,Bought this for my allergy ridden daughter. She noticed a difference right away.
positive,had to order 3 but this one works
positive,Perfect
positive,Seat cover looks to be of good quality. Just be advised that this cover is for the lower profile seat. I need to replace or cut down the height of the seat foam in order for this to work.
negative,"Flimsy, wrinkled... looks like the photo of the ""other product,"" in the listing above."
negative,If you have muscle on your legs these are not for you. Bought the biggest size cause I'm 6'3&#34; and 235 athletic build and not a chance I'm moving my knee once it's on and cutting off circulation.
positive,My son enjoys playing with this.
positive,No issues.
positive,The material finish of this is very nice.  It feels like the leather in my friends Honda HR-V<br /><br />It’s nice and soft.  Has ample space for stuff like your phone or tissues.  Should really help better use the space in a car
positive,easy install looks great
positive,Tool works great
negative,I got the key cut and programmed. The key starts my car but the buttons to lock/unlock/panic/trunk do not work. The guy programming the key changed the battery to double check but there was no signal coming from the key. I swapped the guts from my key that did work but it's very frustrating that it didn't work the way I needed it to. And since I only had one key I had to pay someone to program it and it was nonrefundable.
positive,Do not buy any other! Valeo is great!
negative,"I used this rug cleaner once, following instructions meticulously.  Then in the middle of a cleaning project, both the oscillating brush and the sprayer failed.  I have a low-pile rug that was vacuumed thoroughly before cleaning.  This was on a Saturday and I tried the Rug Doctor &#34;chat&#34; because I wanted to figure out what to do beyond the very basic instruction manual (which I had read). The initial chat took forever -- suspect that they are handling multiple people simultaneously. When I did get a response it was basic, in fact looked as if it were a &#34;cut and paste&#34; job.  Full of typos.  Didn't answer my questions.  I finally asked to &#34;chat&#34; with a supervisor.  Not much better.  It appears that if you have an &#34;air bubble&#34; or your brush isn't working, the only option is to return the entire machine, so beware!  I loved it my first time but second time didn't work and exceptionally bad customer service.  If anyone wants me to post the entire &#34;chat&#34; I will. Very frustrating!  Companies like Rug Doctor need to realize that quality customer service and some additional steps that someone like me could try would have made all the difference in the world."
negative,"Bag was sealed but it was missing the 2 little rubber bushings that slide onto the end of one of the caliper pins on each Side of the vehicle. These move with the pins so they are definitely a wear item. They can also hard or swell causing the pin to seize. Again, had to order a Carlson brand hardware kit separate to get them. Should have returned these before I opened them. You can see the 2 small rubber bushings in the picture. It came with the larger bellow boots and abutment clips."
negative,"They look exactly like they do in the pic, felt a bit odd once wearing them and a lot of wind gets thru, gets annoying after a while, defeats he purpose of wearing goggles. Clip in between came undone on 1st ride. Wont buy again, wont reccomend"
negative,After year in use the metal started to rust out and lock unlock been frustrating to put in and lock and detach. Used silicone and wd40 to lubricate and doesnt do anything.
positive,"Perfect fit, numbers on cap were identical to the bosch unit I replaced.  Easy to install"
positive,Easy way to add a little glam to your cup holders in the car without breaking the bank.
positive,Easy to use
negative,Did not work for 2004 Toyota Corolla.  Amazon sent me 3 button fob but now the listing only shows 2 buttons so maybe they have changed something.<br /><br />I bought a universal remote from Advance Auto Parts and programmed it easily.
positive,Just what I wanted!
positive,Easy to put on the visor but it does require batteries.
positive,Works great on car doors
negative,"Horrible picture.  It looks like they took a low resolution picture off of the internet, and printed it on vinyl.  Totally disappointed."
positive,"Pros:<br />-2 individually packed in the colored box inside a 2-pack white box<br />-Easy to install if you know what you are doing, first timers may struggle a bit but a little elbow grease will give you experience for the next time<br />-Great price<br /><br />Cons:<br />-None as of yet"
positive,"Ordered this when I bought my used 2007 nissan versa because the driver side did not have a mirror. I was afraid that it would be too small, but actually when I received it it was pretty large. Im glad I went with this size because anything larger would have been too big !!!"
negative,Non-standard threads for tires used in USA.
positive,Works like it was advertised.
positive,"This little tool set is nothing special, but it is very practical, space efficient and useful for small around-the-house jobs.  They appear to be well made, but the ultimate determination of that is how well they perform in the long run.  I have written many favorable reviews for small tools of this type, only to have them fall apart within a year.  So for now, I am going to say that they are great.  In a year, I'll come back and update.<br /><br />I like that they are compact and that the necessary tools fold out for use and fold in for storage.  The little plier multi-tool reminds me of a Swiss Army Knife, and it actually does have a couple of different kinds of knives included in the multitude of tools folded into the handles.  The larger folding knife is just that - a folding knife and nothing else.<br /><br />In addition the the small, needle nosed pliers shown in the ad photo, you will also find (folded into the handles) a small pocket knife, a very VERY small flathead screwdriver and a very, VERY small phillips head screwdriver, and bottle opener.  The other handle holds a little saw (or small serrated knife - whichever you prefer to call it), a nail file, a very tiny folding knife, and a slightly larger flathead screwdriver.<br /><br />It would be great for a small household toolbox that you might want to keep lean and orderly, but I think most people already have these functions covered at home.  An even better place for something like this would be the glovebox of your car, because at home you probably have other tools of this type that are more suited to your tool-box.  This is best as an on-the-go emergency tool kit.  They will do a multitude of small jobs in a pinch but don't count on these if you have major work to do.<br /><br />The fold in components are easy to open and close and so this is a convenient device to have and use.  The biggest negative is that it comes in one of those clamshells that put you in danger of experiencing &#34;wrap rage&#34; when trying to open it for the first time.  Because of this, and because it is slightly overpriced compared to similar tools I have seen at Ace Hardware, I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  To be updated at a later date depending on how it performs in the long term....."
positive,looked and worked just like the OEM part but was much more economical. it fit right up where I took the old one off and my car was back to normal. I priced this unit at my local auto parts store and it was at least double what I found it on the internet for. as long as I can save money like that I will continue to use the net for my parts as long as I am not in a hurry for them to arrive.
positive,"Provides enough light (red) to see the console in my truck, but not too bright."
positive,"Notice that left and right shocks are not identical. You need to order them separately.<br /><br />These really seem great. A little tricky getting them on, but nothing you can't handle. Make sure to block the wheels and support your truck with pair of securely placed jacks.<br /><br />Very happy with the improved ride and handling. No more shaking at 60+. Cool!"
negative,it is the same as the one I removed from 2009 chevy Malibu. at least it looked the same my steering wheel is now off some how.
positive,Right size.  Spout makes it easy to pour.  Very useful.
positive,"I might had got the water into my distributor and cause it to short out when I did the heater core flushed and caused my distributor to die. Replaced with this distributor and it fire right up on my 99 Honda Civic. It has been only 21 days, but so far so good KNOCK ON WOOD. I think it is a good price and the quality of the distributor is about the same as the old one in the vehicle if not better."
positive,"This stuff is AMAZING! It takes the rust right off of anything you put into it!! Perfect if you like to restore old hand tools! Or for removing gunk off of bolts, makes them like new again!"
positive,"I really like this polisher. My vehicle is 12 years old and this keeps the paint job looking like brand new. It comes with wash mitt, sponge, gloves, pads, even extra carbon brushes for the motor! All fits into a nice tool bag. Plenty of power for waxing and polishing. No complaints. Works great."
positive,"Perfect for my VW Passat (Wagon). It's somewhat smaller on my husband's Infiniti G37. It's great, though. It actually works. I don't have to worry about frost anymore!"
positive,"Nice little air pressure gauge! Easy to use, fits comfortably in your hand and has a little button to push to let some air out if you find that necessary. I have no idea regarding its accuracy"
positive,Looks great with my Mustang seat.
negative,This smaller one failed completely for my 07 Impala LTZ transmission line. Very lightweight and less than half the length of the oem part. Caused a worse leak than I was trying to fix.
negative,I wrote a review a few months ago saying this faraday bag worked about 60% of the time but it doesn’t work anymore at all. I don’t understand how this product can stop working suddenly. Don’t waste your money. It will give you a false sense of security.
positive,This is awesome! Great value and my flashers and turn signals work again!
positive,"Well built providing confidence when handling poop.  Tight fits, easy moving and lots of attachments.  Pay a little more and get this…it’s worth it!"
negative,"NOT as expected.  It has a metallic look/finish to it, and in a BMW, looks tacky.  Should be regular powder coated gloss red.  Never installed as a result."
positive,Perfect replacement - at a chinese price....... good fit!
positive,Fits my 2018 Silverado. Seems pretty sturdy. Once on it is way harder to defeat than a steering wheel club.  A little more piece of mind.
positive,Fit perfect and look great!
positive,"Son installed this quickly on his vehicle. Original side mirror had the heated option, would be nice if this one had it, but doesn't.<br />Great value for the cost."
positive,This is a great car wash brush.
positive,"After the latch snapped off in my Maxda CX-5 2016 model, I needed a replacement.<br />This did the job and is of the exact same quality as the original.<br /><br />I am surprised that they latch itself isn't sturdier, but that is a design issue with the car itself and not this product."
negative,"Initially,  we were very happy with this RV step for our new Class A. It was everything it was advertised to be. I am 115 lbs and my husband 180 lbs and we are part time rvers.<br />In early Feb (almost 3 montj later) the welding came loose on one  of the legs making it unstable and unstable. There is no contact information to request a replacement or reorder. We understand that ""things happen "" but there is no contract info to resolve.  We will order another required step from a company that has contact info incase of an unlikely issue."
positive,Pretty good price for what you get
positive,It fit and does the job.
negative,"I was hoping for a much heavier mat; these are light weight and slide around quite a bit.  I can't stand floor mats that don't stay in place.  I have had them only a few months, but I am already looking to replace these."
positive,"nice colors, seams are sewn nicely with a tight high quality stitching. So far no stretching or bunching like you see normally with covers"
positive,Wish it came with the wiring to stay lit.
positive,"I always opted for the cheap SubZero Arctic Guard from a local brick and mortar, but I had to use 2 of them. I should of got this cover sooner. It’s good quality and so far it’s holding into place. The FrostGuard in black color must be selling like hotcakes, because I couldn’t find it in stock for a while. Don’t cheap out. So far it’s been worth it."
negative,"Very poor accuracy, not good!"
positive,Is great for the entrance to our motor coach.  I had a cheaper plastic step that wasn't secure and broke after a couple months.  This one is lite and very strong.
positive,So easy to install (10 seconds) and great quality
positive,These are a must have for any car cover!<br />They stayed on even during high winds. I must say it’s nice not having to get my car cover from my neighbors yard or down from a tree.
positive,"I did a lot of research for the best option for the side step for 2018 Tundra, This was installed and worked great, the side plastic came loose, so I called the company 8 months later and they send a set of plastic via FedEx, no charge.<br />There are a lot of accessory company out there but the one who truly cares for their customer always rise to the top, thank you Bestop for caring."
positive,GREAT FLAPS FOR MY TRUCK..LOVE THEM
positive,"I wanted a light bar to help me see better at certain times. There are a lot of manufactures of light bars and they vary from cheap to super expensive. I have read that there are some cheaper off brands that people have had good luck with but that luck usually doesn't lend itself to me. I really didn't have the money to spend for a premium brand but at least Sylvania is a name brand of many different items I have used in the past with above average quality. This light has exceeded my expectations so far with brightness and design. I have driven in multiple rain storms and I still have not had any moisture or water get inside if the light. The breather design looks to be very robust but I will keep and eye on it to make sure it stays clean so it can continue to breathe. I can't really compare the quality or light output to other brands since this is the first light bar I have ever bought but I can say that you will be more than satisfied with this light bar. If you need more light output, add multiple lights.<br /><br />Update 12/15/22 - This light is still going strong. All the leds are still lighting and they are very bright. I have also not experienced any moisture or water getting inside. I have even had it submerged driving through some flooded areas with no signs of water. This light has exceeded my expectations completely. Sad to think there are other manufacturers charging 5 times what I paid and have more negative feedback. Thank you Sylvania!"
positive,Good fit
positive,Can tell there is a quality difference from the original Motor Craft cabin filter. Watched a You Tube video to figure this out.  Took about 5 minutes to change. Fit as it should.
positive,Great quality
positive,I drive Uber part time on weekends n everybody raves about my lights! Easy to install n plugs into cigarette lighter.
positive,Have it hooked up to Holley electric red fuel pump.<br />It’s tied into the trigger wire on the relay side.<br /><br />You do need to back out the wires and repin it.<br />The center slot is for a “red light warning buzzer”<br /><br />So far works as advertised!<br /><br />Larry
positive,I felt this was a very nicely made product. Could be used in many situations. Sadly it did not fit my specific needs. This had to do with my motorcycle not the product.
positive,"Looks good, easy to install."
positive,Moog is good stuff
positive,Perfect fit 2013 Elantra.
positive,"Tested all four Sun Shades on the windows on the hottest side of the house (90+ Degrees) for 8 hours, they stayed put. Didn't have to wet the suction cups first either. Blocks the sun very well but can still see through easily. Best sun shades I've purchased in years, the area around the suction cup is sturdy, unlike other brands where they would tear just by installing the suction cups. There's no guarantee of 100% perfection on any product, but if you receive a defective one, the seller is very quick to respond and replace."
negative,"Beware, ONLY Equalizer's ball works with their assembly.  And if you don't purchase the ball  pre-installed, you'll need to purchase their 1-7/8"" thin-wall socket ($88.00), because a standard socket will not work....And if you have to purchase the socket from Equalizer...well I'm still waiting for them to ship mine"
negative,"Ordered three different covers after being told by seller they would fit my 2004 Tahoe.<br />None of them will fit. They are all too small.<br />Seems this seller tells potential customers what he thinks the customer wants to hear, instead of saying, “I have no idea.”"
positive,I've been stealing my dad's Meguiar products for years. After finally moving out and buying my own house I deemed it the perfect time to invest in my own car cleaning supplies. This line of products works wonders (when used correctly).
positive,"I watched my friend use this once...topped off four tires. Afterwards, I bought one for me and have used it several times. it's a lot easier to use this than to pull out and charge my compressor. This does the job just fine. Set the pressure that you want and it shuts off when the tire reaches that target."
negative,GARBAGE! My battery was low and my car was taking a few cycles to turn over. Left this plugged in overnight and my car still was having the same problem. Left it hooked up another night and came back the the unit not working at all.<br /><br />Went to the auto store and bought a nicer unit. Left it plugged in over night and my car starts just fine now.<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
positive,A good size for my car and sits well out of the way. Well made.
positive,Works good but I'm not sure it does any better than dish soap.
negative,"Could not install in Mazda3, 2009. need to remove the hold headlamp."
positive,This is a good kit for the money.  Cheap horsepower.  It has most parts you need to buy the remaining parts it is very cheap.
positive,"I've had several different types of bicycle phone holders. Everyone of them are good, but have something missing. This has everything! It's very secure, easy to get your phone in and out, and is very high quality.  Love it."
negative,I bought these only 2 months ago and there is condensation in the right assembly…..really like the lights and I’ve contacted the seller about the issue but I have not heard for the seller yet……I will keep u posted
positive,Works great for putting bumper and wheel wells back on
positive,"SUPER BRIGHT! MUCH BRIGHTER THAN ANTICIPATED, BUT THATS KIND OF THE POINT, RIGHT?!"
negative,"DO NOT BUY! Absolutely poor quality.  Sealed non-serviceable ball joint failing in just over one year of installation, less than 10,000 miles of use.  The OE arms/ball joints lasted 90,000 miles.  Having to replace after a short time, labor, added cost for alignment, look elsewhere.  Moog unfortunately is no longer a reputable supplier of suspension components, not the Moog that I experienced in my past mechanic's life."
positive,Perfect fit for my car
negative,These seem to be adequate for the price.
negative,"The flares are just fine.  However, I would spend an extra 4 bucks and get the first alert ones as the bag that comes with those is big enough to also hold a small flashlight.  This set the bag is big enough to only hold the flares and that's it."
negative,"While they look good, their installation directions are off. When we called customer service, they sent the same set of directions again. No help at all. We are very smart mechanical people. This would be very difficult for someone who is not."
positive,Nice
positive,Great product. Fit like OEM and packages labeled for which side
positive,Lightweight and good for the usual yard stuff. Doesn’t kink too badly. Haven’t had it for long but the material does not look like it would become brittle over time.
positive,PERFECT FIT.
negative,"Seems strongly constructed. The .030"" wire loop is too short, making it hard to insert into plug gap. The loop is too narrow to straddle the lug, and the housing hits the plug body. Sadly that is the wire that I needed most."
positive,Finally an oil filter wrench that won't buckle/twist. Had a 4.25 in filter that wouldn't budge. This wrench took care of it with ease. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another in a different size.
negative,Engine on or off. Running or idle the light flickers.  It also has a great magnet. Unfortunately you can not adjust the angle of the light without taking magnet off and loosing screw with wrench. So whatever angle u set it it better be what u want. No quick adjustment. I put it in my work van hoping to angle it where I need it. It is bright.. I'll give it that
positive,covers tires
positive,"OK. I had a Honda Pilot I just traded for a Subaru Outback.  The 'stuff' basket in the rear - with trailer hitch, gloves, blanket, emerg. pochos, wife's picnic items carrier, tie-downs, bungees,etc. etc. - was a folding blue plastic case carrier.  I decided a new car deserved something more 'soft-sided' and, well, new.  I looked on Amazon at many carriers (Subaru's included!) that were termed 'trunk organizers' and I decided the size (of the old foldable) blue box was about right, but prices ranged from the mid $teens to $30s and $40s! This was one of the cheaper ones.  Came quickly (considering the Holidays) and it was as advertised.  Not real soft-sided (plastic sides under the vinyl) but substantial enough.  Price was right.  I figure it will last quite a while - the 'blue box' lasted probably 20+ years! - and I would recommend this item.  Not extremely substantial, not very heavy duty, but just what I wanted and at a good price."
negative,"This product came in our 2013 Sportsmen travel trailer.  We have had it a little over three years and it just quit.  We were in the habit of leaving the fan running whenever we were not using the a/c so we could get some air flow throughout the camper.  This fan does not aid in that.  The fan is so small and doesn't really do much beyond move air from the bathroom area only.  Previous travel trailers had larger, quieter fans that, when even on low, would draw air in the windows and out this vent.  We are looking now to replace this non-working fan with something much better."
positive,I bought this product for comfort and support.  It’s doing both for me.  Helps avoid pain on my tailbone during long hours of sitting down.
positive,Good
positive,"Heavy duty, good quality"
positive,"This is a great product when it's finally assembled however, however the box it shipped in was awful. The poor UPS driver had to pick a few pieces up since things were falling out as he was carrying it.  My other big complaint was that there were no instructions.  I YouTube a video from another customer and used that.  If there were instructions, I would have rated this a 5 Star. Dolly is great and very easy to move."
negative,Update after 10mo of ownership:<br /><br />I've used this on my Jeep maybe 5 times at most. Next thing I know the needle gauge is sitting idly at 12psi.. which makes it extremely unreliable and inaccurate. Nothing I could do about it but toss it.<br /><br />I contacted the seller if they would offer the 1 year warranty.. I'm waiting.<br /><br />+ or - star depending how they respond to this.
positive,"Works Perfect!!!  Added my cables, Drill and a few other things in directly!  Exactly what I needed!"
positive,The top says it all ... It does have directional arrows on it which is nice but make sure you match them to your cars arrows on which way the air flows . When i pulled out the original or the 1rst owners attempt as the car only has 33k miles it was in upside down. So I am glad i didnt just put it back the same way .
negative,Doesn't work very well. Pain in my a**
positive,Perfect fit and works perferct.
positive,Ordered for husband s tractor. fast delivery and he said it works
positive,Works nicely.  Pairing with Bluetooth took many tries but it worked. Emailed support with questions and never heard back. Clearly an abandoned post. Should work for my needs.
positive,Work
positive,"With winter upon us, I ordered this steering wheel cover because it is fuzzy and warm. The cover is easy to install. It simply fits over the existing steering wheel. The cover isn't as cold to hold as the regular steering wheel is. The regular steering wheel absorbs all the heat from hands, and because of that, people who suffer from arthritis are susceptible to painful, bone-cold hands that don't warm. This cover keeps that cold away from my hands so that I can still function in winter. Even when well below freezing, the cover kept my hands warm. I am glad I ordered this soft, fuzzy and warm steering wheel cover."
positive,These things seriously make a difference in how much our 34' trailer wiggles when the kids move around in the back.  Huge fans!
positive,Works better than the Rain x brand.
positive,Used these for the first time to bring all 4 tires up from 30psi to about 42psi. It took a few minutes per tire which got old after a while of watching the gauge move so slowly. I imagine the time would be a lot more for someone draining their tires more than I did.<br /><br />The gauge is inaccurate. Mine is at least pretty consistently 2.5psi high in its reading every time.<br /><br />Aside from it going slow it seems like a good compressor. Just takes patience and I don’t have that much.
positive,"This works well. I just used it and don't have a long-term opinion yet, but I did like how it was fairly easy to use and my truck looks great after using it. I will probably go back to a more traditional wax after this unless I see really great results in the coming months."
positive,Seems I have to replace these things every 6 months. Hurts like h*@! when the trunk falls in your head!!!! These seem to be holding up better than those purchased in B & M stores. Price was better as well.
positive,"East to install ,  extra cushion to prevent the original being damaged . Elastic bands,  no drills-no tape"
positive,Very clean and simplistic....Exactly the look of what my husband was going for to completely change the look of his Tesla after he powder coated the rims black.
positive,GOOD<br />Effectively elevates the front of the bike without disengaging the center stand and dumping the rear (T120).<br /><br />BAD<br />Overpriced. Axle 'pads' are a little precarious.
positive,"Great deal, thank you."
positive,Perfect and great!
positive,Easy install
positive,"love it, looks great on my Jeep"
positive,Super bright
positive,"I ordered this mirror to have the turn signal feature on my mirrors. It uses a festoon style bulb. My only complaint is you can see the signal during the day, but it is bright at night.<br /><br />if your stock trailblazer mirrors don't have the turn signal feature you can use these. They are as simple as plugging in the new mirror."
positive,Works Great now No More guessing how much Gas is left in the Tank
positive,RIGHT PRICE  NO  SPILLAGE GOOD SIZE
negative,"(Very happy to find this filter to fit a 40 year old Can Am dirt bike, A little pricey but can't really complain.) Revised review: Went to install today, but this does not fit my 1982 Can Am Qualifier 175 despite being listed for this bike. Long past the return date so I wasted more than $50. Buyer beware!"
negative,"These look identical to the Dodge/Ram/Jeep ones but don't perform as well.  Specifically, the stems don't break off like they should, or in some cases they don't break off at all.  The real ones are ridiculously expensive and harder to get so these are probably an acceptable substitute for most folks, just know that you're almost certainly gonna have to trim the stems off afterwards."
positive,"Did the job very efficiently, and good time.  My cars have TPMs that light up in the dash when psi drops, especially when the weather gets cold.  Auto-stop function when it hits your set pressure is awesome, keeps the process seamless.  This is a very good product, and well worth the price."
positive,Very easy to use. Installed with no trouble. Fast shipping!
positive,"Wish it was a pack of 3 or could find a single for a good price. If installing on a hard top, you may have to remove the roof panel first. Easiest way to install is with the top removed. Just wrap around and Velcro. I put one on the passenger side (lifted roof panel) and one in the back seat. Didn't have to remove the roof for back seat."
negative,"The lower mount went on perfect, top mount took a lot of work as the bolt hole was just ever so slightly off.  But it went on and is holding as expected.  Just took a while to work the bolt."
negative,Didn't work was broken
positive,"Fits my 2016 F150 well!  Nice, roomy storage, neatly hidden."
positive,"It was a little bit of a tight fit on my 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport 2.0T (a 1/4&#34; would have made it a breeze, an 1/8&#34; would have made it fairly easy too), but I did get in it in there. I will not be able to get it out to check it without breaking it though, so I'll just have to be sure I'm replacing it when the time comes."
positive,Perfect replacement for my 1997 Coleman pop-up camper.  Installation was easy (I used rivets to mount it).  The mounting holes lined up exactly with the original equipment on the camper.
positive,It works to clean the surface as I begin the refinishing steps. no better no worse
positive,Works fantastic on my Rukus teamed with a Polini variator & a Polini Kevlar belt.
positive,Looks like the real factory grill without the high cost.
positive,works great
negative,"I loved that I could finally get an outdoor soaking tub that was not black.  Even though the pictures show it in green, it is black.  Love the quality... hate the color."
positive,Favorite scent! I keep them in the plastic and just cut a small slit to get the stretchy string out and then hang it. Make the scent less overwhelming in the beginning and makes it last longer!
positive,"I used one on my 2 gallon sprayer. These seem well built, and they come with two different sized rubber seals."
positive,Everything went well and they look nice in the car.
positive,"I love our tire cover. It is bright, easy to put on and looks great. Our grandkids love having their names on it. Thanks for a job well done."
positive,"I got these for their looks. They need regular adjustment, and then I need to retighted them.<br />I tightened one too tight, in an effort to keep it adjusted, and spapped it in two.<br />The metal that they are made of is very brittle.<br />So I ordered anouther pair. I'll try again 'cause I like thier style.<br />Since then the company reach out to be telling me of their guarentee and offering to back up their product.<br />The new mirrows seem to be holding their position well.<br />So I'm changeing my rateing from 3 to 4 stars."
negative,Ok product. It’s basically thin enough to trim with scissors. For small cars you will have to trim beyond the existing guidance grooves.
negative,This was supposed to be one size fits all but it barely fit my small steering wheel and I’ve only had it for a month and it’s already tearing and falling apart. This product is super disappointing.
positive,Easy to install and came quickly
negative,"Looked great from<br />Sept-Nov but completely fell apart in December-Seriously, the Minnesota Vikings name is coming out of its place and falling out"
positive,"Got my 3"" cat back off  E bay, cheap but it came with a Thrush glass pac that droned badly at most RPMs. Pulling my travel trailer was a headache. This muffler has a growl above idle and very little of what I would call drone.<br /><br />9/16/19 update<br />Just returned from 1000 mile trip with trailer thru mostly mountains, happy with power increase, but this muffler is still to loud when accelerating with a 5000 lb load being towed. Sound around town without trailer is fine."
positive,"I have a problem with my explorer for 2 years bought this gave me a code replace the part and problem fist. For that I recoment this tool one hundred percent, I'm happy with the tool, Autozone couldn't help me with their tool."
positive,Great!!!
positive,great part
positive,This is exact replacement for the Kia easy to install!!!
negative,"I am so sad to have to give this product a 3 star review.  It arrived today and at first the quality seemed amazing. It arrived in a zippered plastic bag, felt heavy and looked great.  As soon as I removed it from the shipping bag, I realized that one of the rhinestones was either missing or had a manufacturing defect. I've included a photo above with this review. Unfortunately it's a black spot right on the left side exactly where the driver looks as you open the driver's door.<br /><br />Since the bottom has a solid black stripe with no rhinestones, there's no way to turn that spot to the bottom to make the black spot less noticeable.  Amazon offered a return and reship, but I didn't want to deal with the hassle of reordering and repacking and waiting, etc.<br /><br />There seem to be a lot of 5 star reviews so I guess I just got a defective cover.  Other positives: other than the defect, the quality seems great (although I just installed it today) it's actual glass set in a metal mesh and attached to the cover as opposed to those crappy plastic indents, it came quickly, and the package included a cute high heeled shoe keychain.  Hope you have better luck!<br /><br />** I'll try to remember to update this review re: COMFORT once I've driven around with it for a while.  ;-)  **"
positive,"Just as described - Nice product, Shipping was fast, good quality.  I would purchase again."
positive,"These fit perfectly on my 2006 Tundra, and took about 5 minutes to install. They seem a little lighter weight than the originals, which both broke after rusting out in the middle where they bend sharply when the tailgate is closed. Hopefully I'll get 10 years out of these, like I did on the originals, but at 1/4 the price of the OEM version, I expect that they may rust out quicker. We'll see."
positive,I purchase this for my sons bike. He said I did great he was worried would it hold his phone which was a different size and would it be secure enough. He lives in another state. But text me I did a great buy it works wonderful
positive,"I was initially skeptical that a $13 replacement carb would be a perfect fit, and start my generator with no adjustment needed.  I am wrong and it did.  Amazing quality for the price."
positive,"Now I would say this is easy to install as far as compared to any other upstream O2 sensor for my car (2009 vw gti mk5 2.0t)<br />It's in a tough spot, but you can do it from under the hood.<br /><br />It fixed my O2 Heater problem immediately. Had an error code and a very rough idle with the old sensor"
positive,Great product but the bottom right corner covers my renewal sticker. Maybe the bottom right corner needs to be narrower so your renewal sticker will show. Love the heavy duty material.
positive,Material feels good
positive,Easy to use!
positive,Fit like a glove! Thanks!
positive,This fit our old Hyundai Sonata 2009 perfectly. My 18yr old changed the handled out himself after watching a couple of youtube videos.
positive,very good product liking to the dealer
positive,as expected
positive,Good
positive,Direct replacement for my 2015 F150 3.5 ecoboost
positive,This fit perfectly on our 04 Sonata. Not much else to say! :)
negative,Color faded within a year. Looks terrible now. Wouldn't recommend
positive,Does what it's supposed to and adds some peace of mind that my trailer isn't going anywhere.
positive,"Works great! Our Valterra cap kept falling off so we bought a new Valterra replacement cap, which fell off withing the first mile. Bought this one, which turns out to be a much better design and will not fall off!"
negative,We were sadden that they do not Fit our RV. We were suggest by other RV owners to get this set but they do not go on the RV. We are using them for our Trailer tires and they do work great there.
positive,easy install and looks good
positive,I should have added these years ago. They are a must if you suffer from limited neck mobility!
positive,"Mounted a 12000 lbs winch on this so it would be portable.It was cheaper to purchase this than build one.Now my winch is portable I use it on my tractor,front and rear of my truck and also on my trailer makes it very nise to have the winch portable. I did get two big ubolts that go a semi and welded to it to ease carring the winch around as it is quite heavy and akward to handle with out the handles."
positive,Good shirt!
negative,Plastic low quality look nice tho
positive,"Put this on front of my f150 and LOVE IT.  The adhesion is very good and been through a couple car washes and still holding strong.  They are very bright, and some people hit the high beams on me when they see me, but think that has more to do with the high level I placed these (under my hood).  Install not bad - just need to find the right fuse.  Only downside is the lead wire to the fuse box is VERY VERY cheap.  If this was a big heavier, I think you have a better product.  With all that said I am happy with the product!"
positive,Smells great
positive,"i received the items at the correct days given ,and the product was the correct item in  pictures."
positive,Great doesn’t leave a film behind smells clean
positive,"What can you say about a wire form.  This one is pretty high quality and it will serve me well, I think."
positive,"I purchased this Cargo Bag to pack my hunting and camping gear as well as providing a seat for my kids when I put around the property slowly.  I absolutely love it, the seat is comfortable and provides solid back support.  The side bags prevent my little guy from squirming out and there is a ton of room for all of my gear.  The bag also looks great and matches the camo on my ATV almost perfectly."
positive,Worked
positive,"Have two sets of these installed on different bikes. They are VERY well made and finished, not like some roughed-out, bent piece of metal, but they are just plain quality (and I don't give a lot of reviews like this, only when something stands out and needs to be praised). These are strong and rigid, able to hold down about anything (within reason) and do it safely. For the price, they're an excellent anchor point for tie downs that doesn't mar your bars, or break controls from slipping hooks. Well worth the money in this day and age of cheap, breakable, Chinese crap (no offense..., just how it is)."
negative,"Not exact hardware included (screws too short and holes had to be drilled larger, but overall do look nice. Worth the purchase."
positive,Good
positive,"Easy to install, works great, clear view."
positive,"Love, love, love. We don’t spend extended periods in the car; but it is great for storing iPads, masks, toys, snacks that I DON’T want in my seat!  Also, plan on using it during camping trip for easy access and storage!"
negative,Low price!  Good quality!
positive,Love the look. Easy purchase.
positive,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
positive,"Did not come with bolts, was hoping maybe it came with a couple. Other than that fits good."
positive,"Been using this for many years, great product"
positive,"fixed the problem, quick shipping and got what was advertised."
positive,All parts fit and were easy to install .
positive,Great product
positive,Exact fit repair for 2005 jeep liberty crd hood
positive,"Light weight, easy to use"
positive,Use this press on your troublesome ball joints.
positive,"Worked perfectly in our 2003 Ford Windstar!  Unscrewed the old one, screwed this one in place and it was all done. Super easy and made a big difference in how our vehicle runs!"
positive,"The rubber intake boots usually need replacment  every 4-5yrs (it is like clock work). Therefore, for this product to be worth the cost then it must exceed the average lifespan of the factory/oem rubber boots.<br /><br />Below are som pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros.<br />1. Very high quality.<br />2. Comes with everything you need to convert ur rubber hose to silicone one.<br /><br />Cons.<br />1. Very rigid. Therefore, not a lot of flexibility if you are installing this on an aftermarket or modified systems (TB adapter, cold air intake, etc).<br />2. Expensive."
positive,"The seat cover is very nice, Easy to install, looks great.  BUT it is not a seat cover for a hot place like tucson.  It gets way too hot.  That's why I rated it a little lower."
positive,Great shade! Works as described
positive,"I haven't crashed with it, and hope to put that off for a while. That said, it fit my Sedici Avventura 3XL perfectly. It has enough give to be wearable and is comfortable when sitting back against hard surfaces, like my church's pews, when wearing the jacket."
negative,Wish I knew how to contact the company to test their alleged warranty. I installed the wiring harness only for the switch to break into pieces rendering it all useless.
positive,I have a large battery on my diesel tractor which I sometimes drain if I forget to turn off the ignition when I stop the engine with the choke.  This charger will start my tractor without the delay of charging the battery.  After I am done using the tractor I put the charger on overnight and the battery is as good as new in the morning.
positive,great
positive,good
positive,"Simple pairing, came complete (including battery) with extra fob in cool color and restored my remote access."
negative,"The images are a bit deceiving. This is a cheap looking stretch fabric that goes over your steering wheel. The ""bling"" is just pressed onto the fabric, no stones, or even sequins. In person it looks really tacky. Disappointing to say the least. Also the coaster have rhinestones (?) Which makes the items not even look like a set. Wouldn't recommend."
positive,works good
positive,It fits perfectly and is a great replacement. I wish the price was a little cheaper but since I can’t find this item anywhere I had to pay the price.  But glad to have a cup a cup holder back in my older 1999 suburbs
positive,They work great but the fit a lot looser than the halogen equivalent
positive,"My granddaughter loves all the compartments so she can keep water bottles, paper plates, napkins, toilet paper, paper towels, extra clothing, medical and car safety kit I purchased separately."
positive,Happy with it.
positive,"Bought this product for my '14 4runner. Product is typical Daystar quality (great). Instructions on the other hand, could be better. It tells you to disconnect the upper ball joint, when in reality you shouldn't. Instead, (at least on 5th gen 4runners) you should disconnect the bracket that holds the lower control arm to the steering knuckle/spindle. If you go this route you don't have to disconnect all the other stuff the instructions tell you. Loosening the lower control arm front bolt (22mm) will make things easier. Overall great product, just could use better instructions."
positive,"This is one of those purchases I wish I'd just made years ago.  It would have made my road-tripping life so much better.  While the cooler doesn't do a great job of chilling something that's room temperature (I tried it), it does a fantastic job of keeping cooled items cool.  I had this cooler plugged it for a drive from Las Vegas to San Francisco, left it overnight unplugged in the car and the next day my drinks were STILL cool.  According to the product information this cooler can keep its contents at 32 Degree-36 degrees below the car's (or room's) ambient temperature.  If I start with chilled drinks and a couple frozen bottles of water in the cooler, I am able to keep the drinks nicely chilled even through a southwest summer day with an outside temperature of 110oF (ulgh.)  When I'm not on a road trip, I keep the cooler in the car anyway so I can use it to transport ice cream and other frozen goodies home without worrying about melting.<br /><br />While I originally wanted a wider cooler, it turns out this size is perfect for sitting on the floor behind the passenger seat.  I had more than enough room to fit all the drinks and chocolate bars I wanted for my trip. There is a nice long cord that reaches from the back seat of the car to the cigarette lighter, and I like that there's a compartment for the plug to sit in when not in use.  I wish the cord felt sturdier.<br /><br />The cooler apparently lets you keep foods hot or cold by flipping a switch.  The hot is handy for bringing takeout home but I haven't tried that yet.  The hot setting can go up to a maximum of 140oF.  Bacteria can multiply between 40oF and 140oF so don't keep hot food in the cooler for more than 2 hours!  As other reviewers mentioned, it's nice that the cooling fan is located on the top instead of on the sides where they might overheat, but it does mean that it blows hot air out to whoever's sitting near the cooler.  It also means dirt can get into the ventilation grill plates on the top of the cooler.  There's an adapter you can buy to bring the cooler into a hotel room to plug in overnight -- it would have been nice if that was part of this cooler (with a storage compartment for that too.)  Even without that, I consider this to be a solid buy.  The minuses are that it's loud and it's quite a bit more expensive than a regular cooler.  Among refrigerated coolers, the price is competitive."
positive,"cheaper than my oem, and grade 10.9! my oem feels more fragile. installation went without a hitch!"
positive,See the world at night in a different light. You can see side to side & miles ahead................I can see deer stand off in the ditch before I even get close...
positive,"The helmet is good but the wind levers to control intake don't work well.  I'm VERY disappointed that the chin strap is not a snap buckle.  Rather it's a threaded buckle which makes it a pain because it takes longer and you can't do it with riding gloves on.  Otherwise, it's protecting my head.  Good airbag for the moto."
positive,"didn't quite install like the instructions said, they could have been better, but decent quality for price.  took only a few minutes to install"
positive,We had it installed. The problem wasn’t the carburetor.
positive,"very hard to install,,, has nothing to do with the product..its just the place where its located .. you have the dip stick going across where this product goes.. so to help you install loosen the dipstick first so you can kinda move it to the side to easy installation and removal of the old one."
positive,Really Good so far..haven't had long..it does break up the total black that's in my car...I will try to get back later on how ing they lasted..
positive,"We had trouble getting a hold of this locally so thought to check Amazon. Great price and got the three year old back on the little pink quad. She is happy, we are happy and the price was great too"
positive,"Came in a nice Timken box, but Timken is not stamped anywhere on the hub assembly, so you wonder if you are really getting a product manufactured by Timken or just repackaged.  The rotating part with the studs is stamped Made in USA in very small print.  Neither the box or enclosed material gave any indication of where it was made.  Mine came with a new Axle Nut.  Used on a 2002 Pontiac Grand AM SE with ABS brakes. Was a perfect fit and solved the noise problem, I just hope it lasts at least 50k miles.  You remove the plastic piece that holds the ABS plug for shipping.  Factory torque for the Axle nut is 284 ft-lbs (factory nut), but aftermarket nuts should be 173 ft-lbs, which makes no sense, but 173 ft-lbs seems to be the most common recommendation.<br /><br />FYI: I recently purchased a different Timken p/n (HA590070) and the box looked the same, but it clearly said made in South Korea, and the hub was clearly stamped TIMKEN / South Korea."
positive,We will see how long they last but so far so good on my Nissan Altima 2006. They fit like a glove also
positive,"The Sunny Color windshield cover completely covers the windshield of my Chevy Silverado 4x4 Crew cab.  The magnets are strong enough to hold in wind, yet not so strong that pulling the cover off will cause the magnets to scratch.  The magnets are fully encased between the layers of fabric/material to prevent scratching.  (However, pulling anything across a dirty vehicle can cause damage which is NOT the product’s fault.)  There was more than enough material hanging along the sides to close both ends into both front doors to deter theft.  However, when sitting in my driveway I use the loose ends to cover the collapsed side view mirrors instead.<br /><br />This is really a two-in-one product.  Turning the silver side out blocks the sun keeping the interior cooler and avoiding damage caused from excessive sun and heat.<br /><br />I have already recommended this to my truck-owning friends."
positive,It fits my 325xi and was cheap.  What more could you ask for?
negative,"It’s not a full car seat cover, These are not for car seat covers that’s what I thought I was purchasing these are strips that go in the middle of your seat what’s the point of being waterproof is it gonna run off to the side of my cloth. If you want something to make your Carla different then you can do that. But as far as covering your Seats to protect them it will not."
positive,Cool little pockets that hold a lot more than the standard Jeep nets it came with and was extremely easy to install. Best part you don’t have to worry about a saggy sack hanging on your door.
positive,"Small and does the job, takes the guess work out of it."
positive,Fit perfectly on 01 Grand cherokee
positive,This product is made well it's solid I'm happy with the product
positive,"This is was very cool shift knob. My only complaint is that it gets very hot. I live in Florida and have a black car, at work there is no shade so I have to wait a bit before I can drive"
positive,"Eliminates the issue of things falling between your car's console and seats.  On my 2019 Jeep Cherokee the gap seems particularly wide.  My kid's phone would slip through way too often-these fixed that.  Also keeps Cheerios( he eats in the car on the way to swim team) from migrating to underneath the seats.  A win,  My nox also contained a small credit card sized flashlight-and a dash grip pad.  Would buy again!"
positive,"I didn’t notice any mileage gains but I wasn’t using it for this.  My truck at over 100,000 miles needs some maintenance and thought it wouldn’t hurt to use this product as a just in case."
positive,Best dash cover around.  No glare.  Lays perfect.  The only change I would make it to remove the small sliver the sets just below the main dash. The thickness blocks the digital clock. But good value and very good quality.
positive,Compact and Easy. Works great
positive,Fit just like an original
negative,Good match to original. Instructions lacking when trying to code more than one fob. Thank goodness for you tube!
positive,"As advertised and because of the info on ordering the correct size, the tire covers fit as expected."
negative,"I'm not sure why it says it fits a 2010 4Runner. The box even said that it was compatible, but it's not. The 2010 4Runner filter is much larger, and a completely different shape!"
positive,"And they have been hooked together and along with a battery tender, attached to a 200W solar panel as my first solar power set up for emergency situations. I have a 2000W inverter that I can attach to the charged batteries and use some power tools or other electric devices.  I decided to try this out with my 1200 watt single plate induction  cooktop.  The reason being that I spent 5 days without power during the Texas blizzard in February 2021 and I have been working to make sure that I do NOT have that happen again.  So, during the day I have this solar panel to charge the batteries and the battery tender tells me when my batteries are fully charged.  I can then bring them in, attach the inverter to the battery set and plug in my cooktop.  It worked GREAT!  I so have a couple of those power stations but what I realized is that they might power my laptop, but this ""larger"" one I have is 300W - 300W will NOT power anything like the induction cooktop that is 1200W.  I found that most of my electric cookware is at least 600W...so...not useful, not helpful for making hot food without power.  This battery, along with three other batteries gives me a few hours of power without relying on the grid at all."
positive,If you own a vehicle then you totally need a charger/jumper in your car at all times. It used to be that you needed to keep jumper cables in your car in case your battery died. Now you don't need those nor do you have to worry about needing another person to help you out if your car dies. Having a jumper with you is a great way to make sure you stay safe and get yourself out of trouble if you need it.<br />This jump starter has been great. I have had to use it a time or two and it has always worked when I needed it to. It was easy to hook up to my battery and started my car without problems. It's also great to have if I need a quick charge for my phone or tablet. It's just great to have for whatever reason and I am very happy with it. Totally recommend.
positive,"The best wheel cleaner, bar none. You get what you pay for."
positive,Easy to install on the bed floor of the truck the size fit proper also the quality is strong we mostly use for spilling paint so to avoid we put this cover.
positive,"Great product to maintain that wax look finish, great shine easy to apply!!!"
positive,Great product Christopher dodge asked for $1400 for new feel pump those guys have a better product and better price
negative,Cable ripped threw plastic throttle it goes around in less than a week now its broken :/
negative,It still works but it's a little too short for the van windshield. That makes it kinda hard to stay up.
negative,It looks nice but the instructions are poorly communicated. I watched youtube videos and they better explained how to pair it to your vehicle. This item did NOT work for my 2000 Honda civic. Maybe i got bad one. I wish I could get my $ back
positive,Works perfect for holding my purse. I do not have to wonder if the purse will fall over when I make a turn now and spill my contents.
positive,"Got for Granddaughter, she loves it! I love  she loves it!"
positive,Purchased this to repair my HJC IS-MAX BT Modular Matte Black Helmet as one of the plastic screws holding the face shield in place managed to fall out. This time around I used Loctite Threadlocker on the plastic screws to prevent them from loosening through daily use/wear and tear. All the components lined up perfectly with my helmet and repairing it was a cinch.
positive,good chain
negative,"messy, leaves residue and leaves behind dust/debris."
positive,If you check your Tire pressures regularly then that's a great item to have. It gives an accurate pressure reading and stops inflating at the preset pressure. I found it powerful enough to inflate a spare tire from 27 psi to 55 psi in 5 minutes without getting very hot. How durable is it? I hope to provide an update after 6 months use.
positive,"It’s reading seemed a bit off, but maybe not. Just be sure to double or triple check each tire for accuracy. Overall a good feeling product, now to see how it holds up over time! Will update if any problems-no update, no problems!"
positive,"Bought this as the original Volt charger got damaged. Price and reviews were great. Received the device, looked great quality, connected to car and everything is working great. Happy so far."
positive,Fits true to size. My husband it 5’10” and about 185lbs... a medium fits well. Good looking pants and will work well for his DE events
positive,Great portable GPS machine. Easy to use. Better then my car factory installed one.
positive,I reluctantly returned because it obscured the back seat climate controls
positive,Like!
positive,"I ordered these ro connect an extra set of lights on my truck. These connectors are perfect.  Quality appears to be good, you can either crimp or solder the pins.  Comes with male and female pins and connectors and instructions with pictures.  I have not tried in wet conditions yet."
positive,"fit perfectly, easy to install.  No problemes"
positive,"This was a present for my father, I have heard no complaints so I am assuming it was fine.  I would buy from this Seller again."
positive,Absolutely love! Keeps all the trash out of the way and looks great. My only con would be it does take up leg room. I did but the largest though. It doesn’t affect me as I don’t typically have passengers in the middle section where this is.
positive,heavy duty
positive,Easy clip to existing power
positive,For the money they are great
positive,"What is there to say, it is a good price for a headlight bulb. Came quickly and is easy to install. Bright enough for safe night driving"
positive,Exactly what we needed!
positive,"The Trail Boss lift makes it a pain, these are the best. They look great, are well built, and theyll save my seat! The directions SUCK!!!"
positive,Good price and a good product in a well-packaged box. Came with necessary gaskets and grounding strap. Got my mower working again.
positive,Best price
positive,a
positive,I bought these to replace our wind flaps on our Sunsetter awning.  What a great purchase.  They work so well.  The awning is once again silent when the wind blows.  Such a great price too.
positive,"I wanted something that would be sturdy enough to hold all my work gear. Plus have a lid that I can close to keep everything dust, pet hair, and dirt free! And the bonus, is that it has handles on both sides for easy carrying! The slats on the inside can be removed to make the compartments bigger or smaller, big help! It fits all my work gear with ease, including my thick and heavy winter coat."
positive,I like it. Thank you!
positive,Exactly as described
positive,quality.
positive,Worked exactly how I thought it would. Holes for mounting matched up well. I believe I had to cut a tab of to mount in a '99 Dodge Dakota. Cross brackets on the opening of the product were also kind of hard to cut off. Functions and works well though
positive,This was a gift for my wife's car.  She loves it.  Makes it easy to find her car.  Good quality.
negative,Na
positive,"Very sturdy. Had to cut out the back for the connections, but it was easy and it looks great"
positive,"So happy with this purchase! Worth every penny. These mats fit perfectly, don’t budge, and are so easy to clean. Be careful when installing them, because the long Velcro hooks are sharp—avoid letting them go under your fingernails."
positive,"Perfect fit, Cut right. Sun visors not needed to hold up. Great Product."
positive,All good
positive,Perfect fit!
positive,I feel like this good to have especially if you have a pick up truck or if you have a hard time reaching some spots on your car. It makes washing the roof of my truck a piece of cake. It’s really easy to use and easy to clean. Everything can be washed and cleaned. The telescopic handle is also an excellent idea so that you can store it. Solid wheel brush! Overall I’m very happy with this package.
positive,"So I bought a pricey zero-turn mower, and wouldn't you know it ... hitch is optional. The OEM wants 3x this price for the same thing.<br /><br />3mm (1/8th) thick angle iron is stout. I love the magnet on the lynchpin (the OEM doesn't come with the magnet)<br /><br />Nice value for money."
positive,Worked great!
positive,Awesome
positive,Fits Well. It looks like it may be rubber but is hard plastic that is hollow yet strong enough... it comes with a couple of wipes to clean the surface that the two sided adhesive on the bottom side will stick with... 2 months later...still in place !  It adds a good durable look to a flimsy plastic bumper.
negative,"The pineapple scent is so faint you can barely smell it unless your ac is on full blast.<br />The vent clip is really large, you get a lot of product but what good is that if you can barely smell it?<br />When you can smell it, it smells okay not very punchy it’s soft fragrance even less punchy then a candle.<br />I think I should’ve gotten the variety pack because I’m not impressed with pineapple."
positive,"It does a fine job charging batteries, but it’s not as fast as I would have expected."
positive,Good mats but come with a strong odor from the synthetic manufacturing process.  Takes weeks for it to die down.
positive,"Bought a lot of batteries over the years. Some good, some bad. This is the first that is of such exceptional quality I really took notice. Excellent value."
positive,"Super easy to put on the window, easy to remove and easy to reapply. They adhere and re-adhere easily and the wrinkles from being in the storage pouch go away quickly in warm air. They are well made and I am glad to have them. I bet I will use them for a long time and be happy to block out the sun as summer progresses.<br /> I can see through it when I put it on the driver side, but would not recommend it in high traffic situations.  I will use it on drivers side in low traffic and non-rush hour situations though.<br />I am glad to have 3 as I can use 2 on one side to get better coverage at sundown or sunup driving, and when the sun shines onto my legs.<br />Yes I would recommend them to a friend, even if they do not have children or pets.  They are great for adults too!"
negative,"For me, the material is too stiff to be comfortable. Color is as shown."
positive,"I just had new non-run-flats tires installed on my Corvette, so I needed something for emergency.  I tried it inflating tire I had that was low, it worked great."
negative,Pure garbage. Weak plastic handles. Should be taken straight to a landfill.
positive,perfecto
negative,Eh this is a really flimsy sunshade.  It’s been sitting in my trunk since winter and finally got it out to use as it’s getting warmer and really disappointed in the fit and quality
positive,Love It! easy install looks great!
negative,"Like a few others, the reverse polarity light comes on no matter what, even tried at a friends house just to check if it was just my place that the wiring is incorrect but nope."
positive,"I love this trash can. There, I said it. I’ve been looking for something compact that fits in nicely to my car. It’s perfect, because now every time I put in gas, I can empty out my trash can. Thank you for the great product!"
positive,My son wanted this fot his 4-wheeler. He said it looks nice and he likes it. So that all I needed to hear!
positive,Can't go wrong with 3M
positive,This is a perfect Fob! My key is slightly loose because I didn’t want to use both clear plastic panels but that’s my preference. I original bought an identical one on Etsy from luxury fob seller and after months they never sent it. So I went here on Amazon and it was available and I ordered it yesterday and already have it today. It’s beautiful metal very easy to put together. Came with screws and the screw drivers to set it up.
negative,These ripped so easily. I was disappointed. They were very cute while they lasted though.
positive,Seems to be good quality. Quick delivery
positive,ITS A STICKER... It sticks and looks good since I bought it... NICE STICKER... what else can I say! what
negative,It started to melt the wiring on the connector..  hazardous lights .. sent them right back !!!
positive,Perfect fit for my 2013 F10. Don’t let the image sway you. Received is an 18” and 26” blade! OEM
positive,"A little difficult to install, instructions could be better, and the mounting block is huge, but the fit and work well."
negative,I’ve had this for a few months now and all four wheels the entire paint has just peeled right off of them I have no idea how this has happened the only wash I do for my car is go through mikes car wash and I only do that maybe once every two or three months
positive,"I researched for a while to try and find a good carrier for my minivan.  After spending way too much time researching I settled on this beast.<br /><br />The Good:<br />- Sturdy.  I have no doubt this badboy can handle 500lbs.<br />- Easy to put together.  It took all of 10 minutes.  You'll need 2 9/16 wrenches or sockets, etc.<br />- Large<br />- perfect distance from the rear of the vehicle<br />- the bars and mesh enable you to be able to tie-down anywhere<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- The packaging was the worst I have ever received from Amazon.  Actually, the worst from any online retailer.  This thing looked like it was stored in a mud puddle and then beat up.  The parts were not damaged, but bolts actually fell out when the UPS guy was walking up my sidewalk.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br />I used left over soffet from my roof to put down on the carrier.  I also cut a piece to go on the corner where my exhaust exits because I have read about the exhaust heat melting items on carriers.  The bars and mesh make securing a ""floor"" and heat protection very easy.<br /><br />I would NOT buy this again though because the packaging was so terrible.  Perfect product - crappy packaging.  Like a previous reviewer stated, the box was shredded and it was taped... and not even taped well.  Amazon failed us on this one."
positive,"Wow!  Only received one keyless remote with the vehicle we purchased after the flood in Louisiana.  Using the Ford number keypad worked, but didn't always remember to lock up.  Took about 2 minutes because I had to re-read the enclosed directions.  Thanks so much."
positive,"These are a long walk from idiotproof (take it froman idiot).  I thought it would be somewhat obvious which tool to use for my conenctor 9wire had broken off of a pin).  I got these and narrowed it down to 4 different ""keys"" that *might* be the right one, but could nto get any of them to work.  Ended up keeping the keys since it was clearly an end user error, and maybe I will figure them out on the next project.<br />If this review was helpful, please click the helpful button."
positive,"Yes it fits, will tell you how long it lasts, later"
positive,No issues
negative,I think it rides a little rough but you do get what you pay for. It does the basic job.
positive,Simple and easy to use
positive,Works for black cars.
positive,"Perfect fit for my E320. No more noises, and everything I needed was included with this kit!"
negative,"my machanic is putting it in, seems to work"
positive,"Brake pads are so easy to change out, I dont know why everyone doesnt DIY(themselves). Arrived before expected and perfect. Changed out both rear pads for about $45 and under 30 minutes."
positive,"This a high quality wheel hub assembly and I have no doubt that it will last as long as the original. Comes with everything you need. Very nice O rings. Comes with studs.<br /><br />Once you have your basic tools assembled and the truck off the ground this is a very easy replacement job, and gives you an excuse to examine other parts that may need replacement."
positive,Everything you need.  The diodes are small enough to easily hide in the car body.  No problems in operation.
positive,Fits my rpod 179 perfectly.
negative,Looks cheap
negative,"You MUST sand or squeeze with a flare tool the 2 seating rings, they are .020 to large. Measure them .350 then measure hole in block. I sanded mine down to .333 before it would press In with a swadge, and I destroyed the first 2 Before reserching"
positive,"This stuff works!  I accidentally contacted the garage with hubby's new truck.  Ick!  Not my fault!  I think the garage moved!  Anyway, a small amount of stuff and a bunch of elbow grease and it looks like new.  Great product!"
positive,"I used a brush to agitate and scrub, blotted with microfiber towels, then vacuumed with shop vac.  Let dry over night.  Beautiful!"
positive,Supports my vehicle reliably. My car weighs about a ton so having something that can fully support double that weight is a plus.
positive,Works Great!!!!
positive,Buy this and save your awning. Sharp corners of your doors will cut your awning. This will stop the damage!
positive,"This door edge guard is a simple strip of vinyl u-channel with a SEPARATE strip of adhesive. The adhesive is a little difficult to install as the backing is kind of hard to peel off without pulling the adhesive off of the door. But, aside from that, I'm happy with the product. It looks good. It fits well and is good at preventing paint chips on the door edge."
positive,"So far I've dropped this onto hardwood floor at least twice and despite its real low price, it has not broke.  It does look and feel like metal.  I thought maybe it'd shatter.  It's not even dented.  It's extremely pretty and the words ring beautifully to me.  Jesus truly is THE TRUTH of THE WAY that leads to LIFE.  The words that describe his character (the ""names"", as people say) are also good reminders."
negative,didnt fit
negative,The Engineering on this is totally wrong and cheap. Sheat metal screws made of soft poor quality steel where the Phillips heads strip.  I returned mine.  I was ask the have an actual engineer to design and use proper fastener made of US 🇺🇸  metal of good quality.
positive,Works fine.
positive,it is the right product for my Toyota.  Toyota makes its money on after market products.  The original one is plastic and after a couple of years of use it breaks.  This handle was a good price but it will be $50 labor since they have to take the door panel off.  Oh well it's only money LOL
positive,Perfect replacement for my warn outlet cover on my camper.
positive,Excellent
positive,Very heavy and durable. Well made!!
positive,worked great
positive,This worked so great on my husbands seats in his truck! There were water/salt spots from my dogs feet and it came right out.
negative,Would not fit my boat after reading the description. When I tried it was two late to get it sent back.
positive,"As expected. Been on my car over a year. The directions on how to apply were a little confusing, so I had to figure it ut on my own. No problem."
positive,"Easy install, took about 5 mins to install on my 2021 Bronco. Well made. Replaces brake pedal, slips on gas pedal. Fast shipping."
positive,"I had moved the brake controller from a 97 F250 to a 04 Ram 1500. I did not feel like cutting and splicing wires so I bought the wire harness for the Ram. I am glad I did. Using it took me maybe 3 minutes to finish the wiring, and most of that was just running the wire out of sight. Plug and play for the controller."
positive,"My back-up lights work again on a 1999 Dodge Ram 2500 V-10 (NV4500 5-speed).  Easy installation except that you have to do it blind, by groping - I needed a deep socket (23mm I think) with a short U-joint to maneuver, but, fortunately, it turned by hand once loosened."
positive,Fits the Jeep really well on the first install. Held up really great really sturdy and durable until I jumped a ditch with the Jeep going 50 miles an hour over a driveway. Looking forward to ordering another one since this one is tweaked.
positive,👍🏼
positive,It got here quickly and works good.  I have had no trouble with it.  It is a good product for the price.
positive,I like all
negative,"Power switch doesn't work correctly, it is intermittent. missed the return period on this. :("
negative,"Cup holder isn't big enough for a small to-go coffee.  I use it for my hand sanitizer.  The part that goes down between the seat should be a few inches longer for stability.  I'm not a plus sized person, but large enough that it interfered with me using it and using my right leg on my gas pedal.  I only use one on the passenger side when I'm driving alone.  It is nicely colored and I loved the red accent."
positive,Perfect fit for my 2020 traverse.
positive,"Perfect fit, looks great and no problems at all adding it to my replacement grille.  Fast shipping and OEM replacement at a great price."
negative,Calidad pobre y se romper por donde va los agarres
positive,"Built a stand to get it of the floor, it’s mounted in my box truck to take the chill off why working, it is very warm."
positive,It doesn't cover my whole windshield and it is on the flimsy side
negative,My stubby wrenches don’t really fit in the slots.  See in my picture they’re kind of half out - just for your consideration. I’ll keep them until I find something better. Fairly cheap so not a deal breaker
positive,Nice bumper. Perfectly feted to the car. excellent quality. I recommend to all
positive,"For the price, these are pretty great wipers.  We get some heavy monsoons down in Arizona with over 1 inch an hour rains and driving wind and these have worked out fine even in those storms.  Surprisingly, these blades also do a pretty good job of getting dead bugs and mess off the windshield as well.  Installation was easy with no issues at all, quick snap on of the clip and then slid it in the wiper hook.  Definitely recommend for the price."
negative,"This came installed in my 2018 KZ Connect.  It's pretty lame...  No HDMI out for the DVD (in 2018!), so it won't connect to my new TV's as they no longer have RCA inputs.  The audio tone control presets have little difference between them.  The remote is a pile of identically sized buttons that can't be operated by feel like every other remote in 2018, or 2002 for that matter.  Don't lose that remote!  Many of the features are only accessible from the remote, not from the face plate.  I think any decent $99 car stereo head unit (Sony, Kenwood, Alpine, Pioneer...), and a cheap DVD player with an HDMI output would far out perform this thing for half the cost.  I rarely give out one star reviews, but this thing really earns it.  At least it should be easy to replace, as it's just a DIN sized hole behind the fancy faceplate."
positive,fit right in the truck
positive,I love it! We have a Therapy dog and this is a great way of letting others know about him.<br />It works wonderful to get a smile from the car behind you at a red light on a rainy day!
positive,"I bought this AKFACE tire inflator in case I needed it.  Price was good so put it in the trunk. A few months after purchase I got a low tire pressure light on the dash and was not close to any  gas station at the time, late at night. So I hooked up the AKFACE and  3-4 min later, tire was back to normal and on my way. Found out I had a  small nail in the tire causing a slow leak and had to replace tire few days later, but the inflator got me out of a jam and that's all I could ask for. Was easy to use. 2 min set up, 3-4 min done inflation time, done."
positive,Trying to refurbish father-in-laws old table saw. The rust is really deep and the first attempt by following the directions took off some of the deep rust. We got down to the metal in several places.  Simply amazing results. Rather impressed.
positive,"Big improvement over stock halogen bulbs. Just like any other LED there is some radio static, but if you use aux to play music from your phone while driving then there will be no static."
positive,"Worked perfectly for my boat. Didn't spill a drop and tube sucked last drop of 5 gal that I sat on the deck n nozzle just reached tank. Took 2 minutes for 5 gal. Life changer for me. Mind you only used it once, but I'm happy."
positive,"Good value, fit and works well."
positive,"Works as advertised. Hookup is a little hinky. Once you pair it use the app to connect. I got it to work on my chromebook after some trial and error. Start your vehicle, start the app, and connect. It clears codes and has a pretty good help glossary. The rest is up to you and Youtube or Google."
positive,Good value. Rubber in the console is super grippy. Good fitment.
positive,"If you need more light than this puts out on the front of a truck, Jeep, suv, boat, or any other off road vehicle then your need for light may be unsatisfiable.  This curved led light, lights up everything in front of you and off to the sides of you pretty well. The only place you could need anymore light is up in the sky.  By that, I simply mean, seeing the mountain in front of you isn't enough, you want to see all the way to the top.  I tell all of my friends that go wheeling at night, the single best thing you can do for your off-roader is put a good set of lights on her.  If you can't see what is in front of you, the lift, bumpers, tires, etc will not matter.  These lights fulfill any need for light you could want.<br /><br />These lights are built very well.  I believe these are just as solid and bright as anything else out on the market. To install these lights, I would suggest ordering brackets that are perfect for your vehicle.  The mounts that come with this light are basic and will only work if you are mounting them on to a completely flat surface.  I currently mounted mine to one of my Yakima bars and I can remove them with with the bar.  I am waiting for my custom brackets to arrive for permanent install.  The lights came complete with wiring.  In the wiring the fuses, relay and switch have been included.  This system is as simple as routing the wiring and hooking up a positive and negative terminal.  All of the rest has been completed.<br /><br />I received a discount for my honest review of these offroad lights. So far they are performing so well it turns the night time into day time.  I will not be able to speak to life until I have put them to the test repeatedly in different weather conditions.  I am very happy with these lights."
positive,"This is such an awesome organizer for the car. When I have a passenger, I swing it around the headrest and hang it on the back of the seat. As a woman, I have many items I like to have in my car at a moment's want or need ie; hand lotion, chapstick, lipstick, nail file, tissues, eyeglass cleaner etc. It is so handy for these items and a pocket for everything!"
positive,"For girlfriends jeep, she loves it!"
positive,It dresses up the truck and I like it. Shipping was fast and I am totally satisfied.
positive,"too sturdy to be seen as light weight!  That's a good thing, but in rating for being light weight, I can't in all good conscious give 5-stars for something that is hefty.  Not that I cannot pick them up, obviously, but the point of using these is that they should be weighty in order to support the weight of a 350-500 pound off-road vehicle when loading into the back of a truck.  That is what these are made for - attach to 2x8 boards in a length that will be easiest for getting your vehicle into the bed of the truck, slide the ramps into the bed next to the vehicle, and you're good to go!  I got these because years and years ago my ex jerry-rigged a pair similar to this by getting a pair of heavy-duty hinges, cut an 8"" piece off the length of wood, screw the hinge to the two pieces and voila, a pair of ramps.  This was a much better solution for me but in similar style!"
positive,Cooool accessories!
positive,Perfect fit. No problems.
positive,Looks great on my black Subaru and sturdy too.
positive,easy to install
positive,Subject says it all. Fit perfectly.
positive,Good
positive,"The drain plug is 2 in 1, meaning it will plug the hole, and then you can change the oil in the future using the Hex wrench instead of the bolt, which mean you can leave the bolt in once it seals up the drain pan.  This went in with no problem and sealed.  Highly recommend."
positive,"Great product, fit just rite in with no issues. great price as well."
positive,The perfect fit. I will use to change the oil filter on my car.
positive,These are an excellent replacement for the garbage that came from another brand I bought my windshield from here on Amazon
positive,Worked well
negative,It’s a little small for our pathfinder
positive,Good matts but the smell lingers for a while.
negative,"So I bought this in February 2022. This month, September, it has completely disintegrated--you pick it up to position it better on the car and it literally shreds in your hands. It it utterly useless.  Don't waste your money unless you need it only for less than 4 months or so."
positive,"Arrived on time, new in the sealed Timken box.  No issues"
positive,Easy to open and swap out the broken original fab.
positive,Perfect
positive,Works GREAT!!!!
positive,Not into wheel spinners but with bad shoulders this spinner helps so much. Looks very good. Best price an product
positive,"Fit and look great in my Silverado. Eliminates the salt/sand build up in the carpet under the pedals that I used to get with the factory mats. Overall, they are quality liners and will no doubt last as long as my truck (or longer).<br /><br />If you are deciding between these or the WeatherTechs, these do not have as deep of sides but they have much better grip when wet."
positive,Easy to install
positive,I use them on my UTV for Zerk Caps to keep mud off the end of the Zerk grease fittings so far working had them on for 6 months. I put them on a 2021 Yamaha yxz 1000r XT-R fit great.
positive,Got a set fits good .the brake  pedal  has to be trimmed it's real easy. My grip is real good I use a size 14 shoe  not a problem 👌
positive,"These little keychains are so adorable.  last xmas I gave one to my niece, my sister in law and my mother and they all loved them.  To this day, a year later, I still see them on their keychains."
positive,This is a great replacement kit for older trailers with incandescent bulbs that get corroded and blow when they are hot and get wet. LED's are sealed in the unit and much brighter than the OEM lights that came with my trailer.
positive,"Easy install on a 2011 Honda Pilot EX 4WD.  Only needed to replace one side, but was afraid the other one would go soon too.  Got rid of a loud road noise hum that I would hear after getting up to 45mph & faster.  Rides very nice now.  I've replaced all 4 of my wheel bearings for less than I was quoted at a repair shop for just one.  Timken is a quality brand and it says they are ""made in the USA"" on the box."
negative,"It will take many coats of this spray to achieve what you can do with a single dip into the can of plasti-dip. It takes at least five to seven coats to get the equivalent as dipping an item into the plastic dip can. I don't really like the spray. And by the way, you better wear a respirator because it smells awful"
positive,"I have an '09 hemi Ram 1500, I have been using Wix oil fiters for decades when I was a kid all the engine rebuilders, mechanics and gear heads I knew all swore by wix and hastings. Do the research they are a top-rated brand, I knew an engine guy who used to cross cut all the consumer brands you always see on sale and on tv [I wont name them] but if you compare brands like Wix/Hastings/Bosch they are all engineered like someones life was dependant on it. A new Hemi Ram is nearly 40K [sticker] and in a year the bank hands over the title so I'm not going to buy the crappy orange filters just because they have cool commercials. JMO."
positive,Looks good on the truck
positive,this is a great hat.
positive,Nice product at a great price.
positive,Great seat covers. The “grey” is grey with a green tint. The pictures are the real color.  I was hoping for a more neutral grey. Any neoprene left in the sun will fade. I plan on that and will be replacing every few years. Same quality as the more expensive ones I’ve had. Don’t hesitate on these.
positive,"[[ASIN:B000CPCC4U Reese Towpower 74177 Wheel Bearing Protector]]<br />Love/Hate with this product. I had Bearing Buddys on my small trailer and after a year or so one of them fell off. Decided to go with these instead. The other side Bearing Buddy with 2 taps of a hammer it came off. I feel not real secure probably why the other fell off. Had a heck of time installing these new ones though. It's impossible to get them even started to hold in the socket before whacking it. The manufacturer should design them with a tapered edge. I eventually used my Delta 1&#34; belt sander to put an edge on the collar. Still took some effort to get it started once I did I used a piece of 2x4 and whacked it with a 4 lbs BFH. That got it maybe 70% of the way. Had to whack it with the 4lbs BFH metal to metal to get a snug fit. Snug fit is it though, those suckers aren't coming off. My hatred is that in Arizona it's currently 108 degrees and humid from monsoon storms making it a mudder scratcher to work outside; otherwise, thumbs up on this one."
positive,We use it mainly for vacations. We connect a ton of stuff to it in our car. Very convenient and unobtrusive.
negative,"It is so sticky, it is so hard to get it out of the plastic bag. I bought it to put on a foot plate on my wheelchsir so I can put my bare feet on it and it is so sticky, I can't get my feet off of it. And it is so sticky, it attracts every piece of dust and dirt and you can't get it off. So it is ruined now and I need a full credit."
negative,Put it together then on the car it stood on about20 mins fell off went into the next lane. Ive bought this type of hub cap before and never had a problem.
positive,fit perfectly
positive,Love it!
positive,Easy to use easy to read
positive,Not a thing wrong with it.  Works great.  Wish I had bought one with a longer step down.
positive,I ordered this to replace the knob on my slow cooker lid and it fit perfectly.  It was cheap and the shipping was reasonable.  I would order it again if I needed a knob for my lids.
positive,Impressive. Well made.  Stainless and plastic mouting hardware (no metal to rust) was a nice touch.  AWESOME.
positive,"Don't be a tight wad and waste your money on the cheap stuff for your Honda. Honda knows what works and lasts for their transmissions. This stuff is awesome. Use it every 30,000 miles and your tranny will last you forever with no hassles. My transmission shifts and performs soooo much better now that I replaced the fluid. In my 06 civic ex sedan. Remember, u get what u pay for"
positive,This hose is typical of Gates products overall; good parts. Seems to be a bit thin wall-wise.
positive,I saw this advertised on the Internet.  Much better than wrestling it out of your hitch.  Very happy.
positive,it can only hold one of my glasses because there isn't enough room in the holder to hang more .....wish it was made for wider framed glasses!
positive,"I ordered these in black for my mother in laws corolla. They arrived early. Were supposed to be here nov 3 and showed up oct 28. I must say, i didnt expect them to be better than I expected but they were. They may not be top of the line but they are perfect for her. They are thicker than the carpet and have good grip and they look great. Cant beat the price! Thank you! :)"
positive,The seat covers fit as advertised in my Jeep Pilot....I whave a pet and want my seats to not show &#34;pet-wear&#34; when I decide to trade in for my next car.
positive,"Made well, very high quality. Fit my truck cap perfectly."
positive,"It's filtering the oil, what more can I say."
negative,"Why no returns on defective items? The flasher does not work, blinkers work but no brake light activation. I bought another brand and it works great. So I tried to return it today but the seller does not accept returns, even if the item is defective. Not sure why this is a Prime item and you can't return it. $12 down the drain. Wish I could leave zero stars. Amazon is starting to lose my future purchases allowing shady practices like this."
negative,This thing was a waste of money and time. 2 things I’ll never get back. Hail to those who have been successful. But it didn’t work in 2 separate Hondas and one Nissan.
positive,"Simple, effective, and does what it's supposed to do.  You'll need to retract the roof to install them, but that's no big deal.  Recommended if you need assistance getting into your Wrangler."
positive,"Installed on Dodge Ram with 5.7L Hemi.  Single Exhaust.  Nothing else changed.  Left resonator on.  Very good sound, deep low rumble at lower speeds and a good roar when you get on the gas pedal.  I also have a short dual-ram intake with K&N filters.  I do notice a difference in throttle response vs. stock muffler.  Not too loud, just right.  The exhaust is a bit more audible at cruising speeds but not intrusive or annoying.  You can definitely hear the change in tone when the engine system cuts down from all 8 cylinders to 4."
positive,Superbly designed added comfort we needed! Easy instructions to follow and mounted in about an hour!
positive,Very classy looking and durable.
positive,Boyfriend loved it
positive,They arrived and I put them on truck with no problems. They look great.
positive,"I had a very difficult time with getting a lamp replacement for the incandescent lamps which were in the vehicle.  The burnt-out one had a part number which did not cross to any incandescent bulb in Nissan's parts list.  While researching the issue, the second lamp went out.  I was assuming that it was a 194 lamp, but was unsure. It was at that time where I found this lamp on Amazon. Upon installation, the lamp worked perfectly and is very bright...so much so, that I'm considering replacing the other incandescent lamps with LEDs."
positive,"Arrived at factory recommended 0.20"" for my Husqvarna self-propelled lawn mower. Installed the product and cranked on the first pull and ran great. Totally worth the small price to have genuine Briggs & Stratton parts."
negative,Plugged it into my 2022 F150 and FORscan immediately said that this adapter was not compatible and would not write to modules.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A 2022.
positive,Exact fit
positive,perfect fit
positive,"Replaced lift gate struts on my Mini Cooper with these. Old ones still worked. These have been a significant improvement; although, there is still a little struggle to get all the way up. Good value for the money."
positive,Worked great no issues. Solid feel and well made. Recommended
positive,"This is really the same as the &#34;240 pack&#34; - just with another 100 of one of the lesser used connectors (in a bag).  That said, this kit has been a true pleasure.  I have recently had to take apart a few cars (both a toyota sienna and a honda odyssey).  I think the Odyssey is mostly held togther with these things, and taking them out, you tend to ruin one every now and then.  Having new ones of all sizes makes it a pleasure to put things back.<br />The tool is reasonably well made - it's not like it's tool steel, but it's strong enough to do the intended job.  I'm cheap with parts and tools, but this was a good investment.  I should be set for the next 10 years with these."
positive,I like the seat covers and they look great. I would purchase these again. That being said they are not water proof. If water sits long enough it absorbs. Also a friend of mine has the same pair and he has had them for about 2 years and you can see the wear from climbing in and out of the truck. Easy to install on your own.
positive,Excellent
positive,Works better than expected on my Corvette convertible.
positive,I bought these because they matched the color of my car perfectly. They look nice and are so soft. I am a HAPPY customer 😃😃
positive,"Awesome lights! Came with everything and simple instructions. I've been customizing vehicles for over 30 years and these are top notch. I was skeptical about going halogen in today's LED world, but it was a great choice! I love them and will be recommending them to all of my customers. I got the driving light version and can have them on all of the time. High quality parts  and instructions."
positive,Perfect fit and well made. Happy yo have bought it
positive,"Purchased these as motorcycle riding jeans after watching a number of positive reviews. They are comfortable, warm (without being too warm), and I like the added protective padding that doesn't make you bulky. I probably needed a 35, but ordered a 36 (only alternate whole sizes are available). The knee pads are slightly low and actually fall a bit below my knees when standing, but seem properly positioned when on the bike (which probably correlates to any crash position). I was disappointed that they aren't fully Kevlar lined and only partially, roughly in the shape of a pair of swim trunks, but still a definite improvement over riding with only normal jeans. The cut is decent, if a little &#34;old man&#34; Wrangler styled, but I was looking for a decent looking jeans primarily for improved riding safety that didn't look totally out of place when worn off my bike, and these Klim's fit the bill."
positive,We keep this in the back of my wife’s car to keep it all organized. The cooler is nice to put cold food in when we grocery shop and keep them cold for the trip home.
positive,Excellent! Just what I needed for my placard!
positive,Easy shopping on line.  Great struts
positive,The mats fit like a glove. And they are made in America which is another bonus. They will catch anything that spills and anything that rubs off our shoes.
negative,This was the wrong part. (I got it to work anyways)  Have prime but took 8 days to recieve.
negative,Entity to small does not even stretch an inch not even with a men strong hands
positive,Purchased as a replacement for my damaged tow bar. Have used the same unit for several trouble free years.
positive,"Was able to do everything in 3.5 hours; 3 hours for the one wheel, half hour for the other after I figured out the tricks to getting it done.  Installation was done in my garage with minimal hand tools and a jack.  Everything that was necessary was in the package.  Equipment was top notch quality!<br /><br />Makes the truck look awesome, front end is a little stiffer, but handles fine.  Will need an alignment and headlight adjustment after installation."
negative,metal bracket supplied with unit is cheap cast metal. It fractured after 2 weeks of use.  I am going to request a full refund.  Supplied hose is for a lawn mower.
positive,Great smell!
positive,This starter solenoid is a perfect replacement of the factory original.  You will need to salvage the plastic electrical connection shield from the original to use with this one.
positive,Went right in no problems
negative,Broke apart when I tried to put it in.
positive,"I have not used these as yet, but look good, similar to waren"
negative,Not what I expected.  But a good product
positive,"These look great and clean up the door arm area.  Adhesion seems great so far, very easy to install as the opening lines up perfectly with the arm."
positive,Works great. you can power it up with either your cigarette lighter or by hooking it directly to your battery. Very sturdy and a lot easier to use than a scissor jack.
positive,just as described arrived quickly
positive,"I received this as a free review sample. It works as a grab bar on my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander, and will work on just about any vehicle that has a 'U' shaped door latch (it's on the door post behind the driver or passenger.) There are other types of latches, especially on older vehicles, including mushroom-shaped ones and slots, so unless there is a U shape latch this will not work as a grab post.<br /><br />As a window breaker this is probably THE best one I have seen. I have other emergency tools that incorporate a window breaker, but none that come close to this one for effectiveness.  There is more than enough heft and leverage to make short work of breaking out of a vehicle in an emergency. The same with the seat belt cutter. It's another excellent feature that is the best of its kind that I have seen in a consumer, multi-use tool.<br /><br />The flashlight is a decent feature. It's powerful enough to illuminate small work areas and is even good enough to function as a path finder in total darkness. I wish it had modes, including one that would flash, as well as the ability to operate on just one of the two LEDs to conserve battery. As it is, both LEDs either turn on or off at the press of the button. No in between.<br /><br />This comes with two CR2032 batteries - easy to find and replace - and scant instructions that are on the sides of the box. While most of the device is self-explanatory, it would be nice to have instructions showing the locations of the door latches and the more common types with which this will and will not work.<br /><br />Bottom line: this tool has the best seat belt cutter and window breaker of any I have used or tested. You need to verify that the grab bar will work with your vehicle, but even if it does not, this is a handy emergency tool in its own right."
positive,I just received it yesterday. The cover fits perfectly. It looks great on my brand new 2017 Toyota Tacoma. I would definitely recommend this those who are looking for a heat shield for their Taco.
positive,Usually don't write too many reviews but this product serves my purpose and does the correct job.
positive,Comes in handy when you actually need a coolant funnel.
positive,Good
negative,These were supposed to work on my 2011 Ford Escape and did not fit at all.  I used the search engine to find only products that worked on my vehicle but apparently it does not work.
positive,"I purchased the Cyclops CYC-S35012VR Thor (12-Volt, 3.5 million candlepower) spotlight for my Jeep. It is ruggedly built, and plugs directly in to the cigarette lighter. There is no battery. The cord is a few feet long, enough to reach comfortably from the cigarette lighter to the window of the Jeep. The spot is very bright and round out to at least 100 yards. Great deal for ~$30."
positive,"This set was a great value! Perfect for my at home tool box. I purchased these to replace much older versions of socket organizers, and these work great. I love the color coding for the different size drives.<br /><br />These are nice. They help keep the sockets vertical in the drawer. And you can just grab the rail and take it to get the job done. I wanted to divide my tools into two sets, one for my son and one for me. They hold sockets well, keeping them organized when drawers are not practical. Very nice!"
positive,Very easy to install  works great
positive,Has automatic option.  Only thing I did not lick  is the cords wasn’t long enough. there about 4 ft each. Wish they were longer.
positive,good product
positive,pretreated the chamois and it works great.  my Wisconsin Badger Red Tahoe looks great after treatment with the chamois
negative,[[VIDEOID:55074d6529a134dd205acd356d5346f9]] Why they wouldnt include a nessasary oring is beyond me. Buy another brand of kit.
positive,As described. Used 1/4 ounce during new evaporator core install.
positive,I purchased this for my daughter to have before the winter snow comes. It was a Christmas gift- I overheard her say she needed one of these.<br />Right after Christmas it snowed two days straight and she was very happy and grateful that she had the window shield cover. She said it was easy to place on and found it very useful.
negative,I used this recently to clean up power steering fluid spill on my driveway. It works ok but it is not as absorbing as other products I have used in the past. Also it can only be used one time. All in all for the price it is decent but not the best.
positive,Nice hitch
positive,This cover keeps the fob from getting its lock pressed in the pocket - might unlock unknowingly - this saved us
positive,"great price, looks good and is strong ."
positive,Perfect for my 2013 f-150 5.0!
positive,I bought this product to use at the gym on stationary bikes that didn't have a place to set my phone so I could watch TV. This mount adjusts to a large range of equipment that I've mounted it on and holds up my phone. It is very secure both in the mount and in the mechanism used to secure your phone in the mount. It doesn't move from vibration. I also like how easily you can switch orientation and adjust angle and how well it will hold that angle for you.
negative,I literally opened my packaging to TWO dirty mats. Please be mindful that these were not a used/warehouse purchase. So how/why they arrived looking like they had been used multiple times is confusing to me. I am definitely in need of a refund
negative,Broke first time unlocking it.
positive,Great wax
positive,"I purchased this light bar to put on the back of a topper on a truck, to light up the area when I am launching my boat. When I turn this light on it is almost like daytime now. As of this writing it has been there about three weeks during some big heavy rains and so far it still works.,"
positive,Like
positive,"Fit perfectly on my 2010 Highlander<br />The old one was OEM, I spent some time looking for just the rubber refill, but this was so cheap I just replaced the entire unit in like 60 seconds flat."
positive,"Handy and effective, even if they're bulky."
positive,"Good, solid little ice scraper. I'd order it again."
positive,Raptor style grille light for 30$ while everyone sells it for 80
positive,"Sizes listed in reviews and the two in the description (15.8 x 10.5 x 5, and 12.5 x 9.5 x 7) don't match to what I received...<br />The bag I received is in between what has been listed in the descriptions:  13.5"" x 9"" x 6"" (empty).<br /><br />While seemingly a good quality bag, with a fair amount of straps and attached rain-cover (hidden in the heel of the bag), it seems the manufacturer (or seller) has no idea how to use a measuring tape!<br /><br />The bag itself is quite nice... good padding, rubberized bottom to prevent sliding, small pockets on either side, and zippers seem of reasonable quality.<br /><br />For the price and bag quality, I'm not complaining.  It works great on my CB750, and it does fit on the pillion of my VT1100c2 (without having to remove my rider backrest)  So if you have standard seating (or a touring/adventure style), this bag will do well for you as a pillion bag, and with a little strap adjustments, it also fits vertical on the front or back of a sissy-bar, or horizontal on a larger luggage rack..."
positive,Good product good price.
positive,My husband loves it for sitting on and putting air in the tires. Moves around the garage great.
positive,"Great product, worked perfect when a branch went through my RV cover"
positive,"I was replacing some older fog lights on my Jeep, and these caught my eye.  I spliced into the wiring on my Jeep's factory lighting, and installed these in their place.  Aiming was fairly easy.  I would add that you need to leave all bolts a little loose, hand tighten them, aim the lights, and then tighten them all the way with an allen wrench.  A little bit of loctite would help as well.  They are much brighter and have a good pattern to them.  A real supplement to the dim factory headlights that come on older Jeeps.  I drive down some winding, hilly, two lane roads where I live, and these light up the roadway very well."
positive,General use
positive,"Very easy to use, rubber hose is flexible and provides excellent mobility to adapt the air chuck to any valve stem.<br /><br />The tension clamp ensures the air chuck will remain in place for a one hand operation. Gauge is easy to read and accurate. Functions as described and was surprised to see an air fitting included, great bonus!"
positive,Fit good
positive,"I actually bought this to charge my 2009 Honda Metropolitan scooter which is something like a Vespa. However days after I bought this charger,  I was all dressed up to go somewhere, but my 2011 Honda Element was dead. There apparently was enough juice to turn on the lights, but when I turned the key in the ignition the motor was flat dead.  I called AAA to give me a jump, but I was told I already use my four service calls within the year.  So I asked how much would it cost to come out and give me a jump? AAA wanted $95! I live in a metropolitan area, so I am surely just minutes away from an AAA contractor, and in the past when this is happened they used a portable jumper and the guy was gone in less than 5 minutes. No way was I going to pay AAA such a high price, especially when I’m already paying them a lot for their premium membership! Luckily the thought came into my mind to try this little charger because I remember in the reviews some people say it even started their car.  I am not at all a mechanical person, so I watched a YouTube video on how to do this, then I hooked the cables and let the unit run for less than an hour because I really had to be somewhere. When I then unpowered the charger, removed the cables, and turned the key there was at first a very slight delay, and then it started right up! After a couple pumps of the accelerator it sounded as good as new, but I did go directly to a shop and had a new battery installed. I am not only super thrilled that this little charger did a great job on a fairly good-sized car, I felt great that it was simple enough for a dumb blonde to operate it successfully. Best of all, I didn’t give AAA the victory of gouging $95 from me in a near emergency situation. That’s why am taking the time to write this review!"
positive,"Wish it to be slightly thicker for sound dampening purposes but other than that, great liner that fits like a glove."
positive,Brighter than the originals
positive,GREAT product!  Exactly as described.
negative,This pate holder is not long enough.  Unless AZ has longer plates than the rest of the country I wouldn’t order this plate holder
positive,Fit perfectly.
negative,poor built quality.
negative,"Front emblem is not only the wrong size for the 2014 Silverado, the attaching prongs are in entirely the wrong spots and the wrong shape! Spend the money, search Genuine GM (23463799) Bowtie Emblem and order that. It costs more but it’s OEM and it actually fits!"
positive,Back on the road again.  Thanks
positive,Fast shipping & perfect fit for my 2018 Ford F-150 super crew
positive,Loveeee this!! It’s so pretty!!!
negative,"After less than two years, the gas is coming right through the hose.<br />Looks nice but not made well."
positive,"Direct fit OEM shock, enough said."
positive,"Great winch switch for my UTV. The lights are independent from each other. When you press winch in, that light comes on, when you press winch out, that light comes on. If you want it permanently lit for night riding, you will have to cut 2 of the supplied wires as each light is daisy chained to the winch in/out signal."
positive,Will keep your vehicle's carpet looking new!
negative,Indoor only!
positive,A+
positive,Very bright solid construction. We'll see how long they last
positive,"I have bought husky floor liners for two of my vehicles, the fit perfect and make it easy to clean , excellent product !!"
positive,Works perfectly
positive,Good
positive,The best vehicle battery charger I have ever used.  It resurrected two virtually dead AGM batteries to full operational capacity!
positive,"Purchased this hose for my boat. Great quality, low price."
positive,Arrived just as promised and they are exactly what I needed.  Great product.
positive,I ordered the wrong mirror. I didn't realize I had the auto dimming feature. I can really tell the difference because this one doesn't have it. But that's my fault. It was simple to install and otherwise what I expected.
positive,"Heavy and bulky, but awesome custom fit and color matched to my van."
positive,Does what it is designed to do.
positive,This is a life savor! My car battery used to drop to less than 7 volts and every time I needed to jump start even if I stop at grocery for 10 mins. There comes this Arteck 800A Peak Portable Car Jump Starter and it is really helpful! I used to jump start my sedan at least 3-4 times with single charge and also the battery backup is awesome. Kudos to Arteck team. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for portable jump starter!
positive,Great product
positive,"Super thick mats, heavy! I love them. Great size. Perfect for boots! I ordered 2 and they fit perfectly in my front closet!"
positive,"It was fun, affordable and got the job done. May be a future Christmas present"
positive,"They are very nicely done especially for the price.  Very warm so far even without the quilted liner. (I'm in Montana).  I bought the 5XL's thinking these are usually cut small.  When they came they were much too big so sent them back and ordered the 4XL's, which were still a little large but wearable.  My advice, check their website and ordered the exact size as recommended.  I didn't want them even slightly tight so the ones I have work for me.  Haven't tried them in the rain but leaving the rain liner in just in case.  Very good quality, so far."
positive,Keep people from stealing gas.
positive,"Great upgrade to the interior of my 2017 Tacoma TRD Sport (automatic transmission).. this feels bigger than the stock shift knob, and has small red accents as seen in the photo (which look great given that my truck is red).  Installation was easy - just un-screw the old knob and screw on the new one.. took less than a minute to &#34;install&#34;.  Would highly recommend!"
positive,"Nice 20"" light bar, aluminum casing.  Mounting brackets and cables included.<br /><br />Input voltage 9-30v DC - fits 12 volt 24 volt vehicles and boasts 70 x70 LED lights.<br /><br />An interesting feature of this light bar is that you can cycle through six light modes. Wait, amber, white and amber, white flashing, Amber flashing, white and Amber flashing. The light bar will default to the last mode you used.<br /><br />Like with all of these light bars, the real test will be longevity. How long will this last in the elements? Is it truly waterproof? We will see.  Updates to follow"
positive,Perfect fit on my 1999 Honda Civic LX.  Easy install.<br />A lot better than the OEM bulbs
positive,"Perfect little kit. The can of Proofide, though small, will last years."
negative,One of them already quit with only 10 or so hours on it.
negative,I like them better than other rain beading wipers but they just havent held up like Id hope they would.  They have been pretty streaky since about a week after installing them and they dont seem to sit as flush to the windshield as they should.  They do bead up rain very well and have continued to do so after months of use.
negative,"These come with a very small elastic cord with an S-hook on each side.  When the cover is slipped over the tire, it is impossible to fasten the two S-hooks together.  Even if they could reach each other behind the tire, you would need to lay on the ground and under your vehicle to fasten them.<br /><br />A long time ago, the wheel covers I had for my RV had a built-in ring/hoop that slipped over and around the tire.  To install the covers only took 30 seconds.  With these that I purchased, they are impossible to install over and around the tires."
positive,Very satisfied. Great price and fast delivery.
positive,Fits just right
positive,i actually dont use this in my car i use this at work so i can see people coming behind me! hahahah works great
positive,Fit perfectly and held a lot of stuff!  We did not encounter any rain so I can not speak for it's waterproof claim.
negative,"The License plate frame seemed thick, sturdy and made very well except when the discription says it’s purple I expected it to look like the picture, but it came to me an EXTREMELY light shade of lavender, you can barely even tell it’s “purple” at all."
positive,Worked well. Nice little carry bag. A little expensive but worth the convience. I put it together and used it just fine. No objections. Foam spray is significantly better especially for streaking issues.
positive,Excellent fit and looks great. Way easier to install than the lower door chrome molding.
positive,good
positive,Worked great
positive,Needed an extra key fob for my 2007 Tahoe and 30 days later still going strong.  It was easy to program and distance is at least 25-30 yards (that's about all I've tried). Quality appears to be the same as my OEM.
positive,Nice feel and fit
positive,"Fit my 2002 Ram 15oo Quad Cab perfectly. Wish I had purchased a new tailpipe, the old one was rusted on the bend and the hot exhaust melted the rubber jacket off the e-brake cable going to the rear-driver's side. Great muffler, very quiet without any sacrifice on power"
positive,Great tester for the money.
positive,My mechanic changed the bulb with no charge.  Great replacement light Bulb!
positive,"Easy to install, fits perfectly, and looks great! I will update if the durability doesn't hold up. But so far, first impressions are solid. 5/5."
positive,"Bought a pair of Excel-G for the rear of my '09 Honda Civic EX-L commuter.  The factory shocks weren't blown but damping ability was almost gone.  The Excel-G looks 100% identical to the factory shocks that I removed.  Installation was straightforward.  Removing the rear wheels helps a bunch with getting access to the bolt on the suspension side.  The shock mounting grommet at the attachment to the vehicle body is identical to factory, so it firmly mounts to the body like stock.  When installing the shock, keep the shock centered on the upper mounting hole as the upper mounting bolt is tightened.<br /><br />The factory ride quality on this car is very good, and the Excel-G returned the rear suspension to factory damping quality as desired.  No bounce.  No harshness.  Great ride for just getting along.  I am puzzled why some reviewers experienced poor ride quality.<br /><br />I've only got 1000 miles on these, so too early to comment on longevity."
positive,Perfect
positive,great deal on an awesome part
positive,These mats are made for this vehicle.  Great quality and fit.  I would recommend to anyone needing protection in their new vehicle.
positive,Just what a Florida boy that moved north needed. Works much better than the credit card he was using to scrap his windows.
positive,"My suv reminds me of a stormtrooper, so naturally I named her Stormi the Stormtrooper. She wouldn’t be complete without this front plate!"
positive,"I had a very slow leak in my coolant system and I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, but I saw a small puddle everyday in the left from corner. I didn't want to put just any stop leak because it can mess up you coolant system. After alot or research this stuff claim to be the best in European cars so I gave it a try. It didn't do anything the first few days, but after about a week no more puddle. it's be sometime now and still no more puddle and my coolant is still full. This stuff is also like glue and it claims it would harm the system."
positive,"Works great, everything is dry so far."
positive,Great product. Was easy to install and look great.
positive,Serious beef here; built better then the wires they connect
positive,Has been immensely useful so far. Something has been draining my battery recently and I have had to use this multiple times. It’s quick easy and portable and I have done 3 jumps so far and the battery indicator still says it’s full
positive,So nice looks great on truck Go Vols
negative,This is awful. Broke on 3rd use. First two uses were slow anyway. Not tires of course. Just household inflation chores.
positive,"We have been having issues with our solar gate and still in the process of figuring out the issues.  We think the motherboard charging circuit is faulty.  We needed something to charge our 12v gate batteries.  We had two smaller 7a batteries and a large 100a marine battery.  This charger worked on both.  Hubs said it is a little slower than expected, but did the job no issues.  More well known brand."
positive,"Easy to install, for my Honda Accord must use genuine parts."
positive,These were easy to install. The adhesive is super strong. I made sure to clean off all the surfaces with alcohol wipes before and it adhered no problem. It's very bright and out of sight which I like.
negative,Very Cheap and the tabs broke off on two of the covers trying to install them... ended up just buying new wheels.
positive,If you like bling you will love this
positive,Nice for car<br />Long commute
positive,Worked perfectly.
positive,I bought this beautiful sturdy bell for my husband actually for the bike. The saying is what sold me on this bell. Now he won't have to worry about road gremlins
negative,No le quedaba s mi auto
positive,This was what I expected. No problems or issues.
negative,"At first glance this looks like a terrific gun case for a hunting trip or, in my case, storage in the barn office for a rifle and shotgun. I have a hog problem out here that can be a serious danger to humans and horses. I have had to warn them off more than once in broad daylight, keeping a rifle handy is a must. I mostly want to use this case both in the barn on on the gator or tractor depending on my needs.<br /><br />The problem is that the stitching on the straps is weak. As are the rubber pulls on the zippers around the gun pockets. These are critical components for regular use and safety. If I am bouncing around in the pastures with a herd of wild hogs around and rifle falls off the back of the tractor because the carrier straps came unstitched, that's a problem. The system is not designed for the weight of two guns. Nor is it geared for a true hunting rifle with a scope installed. It's probably just fine with a single weapon inside - our Remington 870 is quite light compared to some of the bolt action rifles for example. I darn sure won't be carrying the Benelli shotgun in this unit though!"
negative,Did nothing at all.
negative,Stopped working in less than 3 months. Guess you get what you pay for in this case.
positive,Fit good
negative,"very super preety, just to big for my ignition button: therefore i m returning it"
positive,Excellent bargain
positive,Fit like a glove beneath my tire so I could easily hook my boat up and go
positive,Love my new license plate frame.
positive,"Great product .. I was hesitant at first. My item arrived on time and unbroken,I love it ! Great addition"
negative,"These things are not cut anywhere close to straight. The rubber bushings are about twice as thick as they need to be leaving a huge gab. They would be easy to install if they were made properly but these things need a lot of work to be put on right. You might as well buy the cheaper off brands. If you have to do a lot of mods, at least it didn’t cost you an arm and a leg."
negative,"I found out the hard way that I prefer the kind that are roughly rectangular and allow you to adjust the angle of deflection. These reflect a lot in a little space, making it more difficult (for me) to see what's going on. The rectangular adjustable mirrors seem to show a larger image and allow you to pick out what part of what's behind you that you want to see."
positive,fast and functional
positive,Help keep back of jeep organized/ easy to install! Definitely a must have when your traveling or keep items in back
positive,I use this every week to top off my tires. It's a little loud but that doesn't bother me any.
positive,Good product.
negative,"Received Mazda instead of Lincoln. Quality is great, just wrong item.  Box said Lincoln, but not what was in box.  Will return for correct item."
positive,"I fit these to my 16 Road Glide.  (don't try at home, it took a little sillicone) the quality and build of them however were perfect and I am sure they are the perfect fitment for the recommended years."
positive,They provide so much clarity I felt blind when I had to drive a rental car for a few days.
negative,Mine only lasted 6 months. now i have RAIN-X SILICONE
positive,So far it has been holding up well.
negative,"Poor quality, broke within a week."
negative,Does not fit advertised application. My truck is 2001 dodge quad cab
positive,Works great for stuff you want to leave in your trunk or anything else. Only issue: it's quite large and takes up over a third of my trunk. When you need the space it's awkward to remove or push to the side.
positive,"true size as charted, love it, excellent deal"
positive,"Great product. Fridge stopped working, replaced the control panel which partially fixed the issue but fridge still wasn’t cooling. Could tell the compressor wasn’t running as it wasn’t vibrating and I just heard occasional clicks. Replaced this relay in about 3 minutes and fridge is working again."
positive,Im not crazy about the smokey lenses on these lights. I prefer clear but my husband like the smokey color. We've been using the lights for a week. It took my husband about an hour to install both. Pretty easy installing. The lights are bright and look great at night.
positive,Great item
positive,Great product. Slim but sturdy. All hardware included. Like the covers over screws to keep the 'blackout' look.
positive,Haven't installed yet but can't wait to see how she's going to look from the back.
positive,"According to the size chart I needed a large, I ordered a large, and it fits perfectly. Snug to my head, I keep my head clean shaven so I imagine if I let my hair grow in this may not fit as great. I’ve seen reviews complaining about “mushroom head” and yeah there’s a bit of that. They don’t advertise as being the thinnest helmet so you kind of have to expect that. I ordered the skull and riders design and it looks great in my opinion. I like the quick release chin strap, I’ve never been a fan of the double ring straps. So this is a 5 star helmet for me!"
positive,"I bought this for my hydroponics garden.  I have to switch out the water and nutrients every so often and it gets kind of messy.  This has made the process so much easier.  Instead of having to lift the bucket to dump it out, I can use this to siphon it out into another bucket.  It works equally well for large or small volumes.  The battery life is great and I haven't even needed to change them yet.  I plan to buy another one for our rv."
positive,"Works like a charm and replaces the very dim lights that come stock with Subarus. It wasn't super easy to install them and we had to loosen the battery and air filter compartment, but we got them in and they are so much of an improvement for night driving. Nothing is going to match the power of Xenons (I was spoiled because I had them on my 2012 Mini) but these are a close 2nd. As for longevity, I can't say because we put them in a week ago, but hopefully since they are LEDs, they'll last a good long time."
positive,"This was a gift, but the recipient was happy I got the soft brushes as they felt they would use them more."
positive,"This sun screen is the best we have purchased ever. Fits like a glove, Saturday and best of all it really works good."
positive,Much cheaper than ordering a whole new fob.  Fit perfectly for 2011 Honda Odyssey.
negative,"One of those things like insurance or a standing army you hope you never have to use. It meets the requirements of Hawaii trailer rules. and  is an inexpensive way to do that.<br /><br />For my heavier trailers I use 5/16 grade 70 bulk chain with no extra welds terminated with 6 inch dual lock clips that are like a double safety pistol that requires two actions to allow the trigger to drop the hammer.<br /><br />This safety chain is adequate if you follow the chain rules of cross under hook up that gives minimal play if coupler fails while giving maximum turning angle.<br /><br />The obvious shortcomings with this chain hook and strength is that it is conceivable that the hook could jump out of the receiver due to impact of some kind.  Probably never happen to me but bad things do happen like blow outs that make the wild ride of Mr. Toad seem tame.<br /><br />Curt sells chains and hooks that are more desirable and if you look at the difference in ratings between use and test strengths. this should be your guidelines.  2000 pound trailer = 20,000 pound hitch and safety chains. is a good number to live by."
positive,Works great - bought 3 of them
positive,Worked perfectly. Exact replacement.
positive,"These are good wipers, but difficult to install. I don't know why they make the directions so difficult. As if anybody could understand the drawings on the back of the package. Once on, they work well, no squeaking, and I like the flippy end."
positive,these things work perfect for my 350 center bolt valve covers and all my plug wires are nice and neat.<br />im super happy with this purchase and price.
positive,"I like it and it seems to be exactly what I ordered. The red trim gives it a sleek and edgy look! I have the 2018 Honda Civic Hatchback and all the pieces fit perfectly. Be aware of the fact the main front area and driver section have their own kit and the back seats and doors have their own kit as well. What was confusing is there was one part for the center console that actually was part of the backseat kit (it is the larger sliding coin tray not the small coin tray if that makes sense). My only critique is that the liners for the back cupholders don't stick in place when you put the cupholder rest up (granted I am not planning on using the back cupholders and will use this as a seat for friends). The liner falls out when the cupholder rest is put up so I took it out. Otherwise this is a very slick and affordable way to add more style, color and get a first line of defense to sweaty or leaky cups. I plan on owning this car for at least 5yrs and know how much corrosion can happen if you don't take care of the inside of the car."
positive,"Excellent quality, love the real carbon and love the lock nut thread-on design."
positive,great product
positive,Check engine light and all others gone. Great price and not to hard to install.
negative,"Ordered these not too long ago as the mirrors on my 2009 F350 needed replaced. Put them on today and the running lights don’t work, heated mirrors don’t work, electric tow mirrors do not work, and electric adjustment does not work. I’m very disappointed."
positive,VERY BRIGHT.
positive,"I've had this fridge for just about a year now and it is fantastic. I like the fact that it's not metal so it's tough and won't dent. The thermostat works great and it keeps food cold. I've traveled in my Westfalia with this fridge for a month at a time - there's no comparison to the built-in fridge. It's quiet enough although you can hear it turn on at night. Not so loud as to be a problem. I use it with a very small gel battery and a small solar panel. If the panel is out all day then the battery will keep the fridge going for 36 hours or so.<br /><br />There is a gradient in the temperature inside the fridge from bottom to top. This actually works out really well for me as I put items like milk, cheese, meat, etc at the bottom and fruit and veggies at the top. It's performed consistently in temperatures over 100 degrees. Highly recommended."
negative,It’s so pretty but doesn’t fit on my 2018 Ford Escape. I am so disappointed this didn’t work. I will be returning it tomorrow sadly.
positive,Good
positive,They are easy to install and tight fit. No worries of the coming off. The chrome is very shiney. Compared to dealer OEM of $140 these were a no brainer.
positive,"I purchased this case to store our Hulkman charger in and the charger and it’s accessories fit perfectly. The case will protect the charger well while it is stored in the car. I do wish the instruction manual for the charger fit in the case as well. The case has a nylon zipper that I hope will hold up over time. That being said, it is a nice case for a Hulkman."
positive,"I wanted to put it on my Prius, but other than mounting it on the roof, I couldn't find a spot. I put it on my F-150. This puppy is LOUD!!!"
positive,Awesome organization for The car with grandchildren!
positive,I needed a new door handle because mines broke...fits perfect and i can finally open my door from the inside again!
positive,"I have a SentrySafe pistol safe that was no longer lifting the lid after the strut slowly failed. Tried this one and it worked great. You don;t even have to unscrew the whole strut from the safe, you just unscrew the end pieces to remove old strut, and remove end pieces on new one and screw it into end pieces attached to the lid and base."
positive,"After putting up with my visor falling down, a  quick fix from YouTube. A 5 minute install. So glad this vlmpany developed this little device. It works extremely well! Probably have to wait several months for a Mopar fix. Parts are  all on on back order. So pleased with this product. Buy it! Keep it in the glove box. This is a common design flaw for newer Wranglers & Gladiators. Highly recommended seller."
negative,Image used through no fault of the sellers are incorrect SmittyBilt uses the same image for all their light bars which causes a misleading impression and representation of their product.<br /><br />The Light Bar shown is for a Tacoma and the actual Light bar model shown is number 150010
positive,Great
negative,"Basic and effective on tires, but does not have the accuracy required to be a depth gauge for woodworking as I'd hoped.  That is not a bad thing at all, but don't expect more."
positive,Brackets are good for light bar but small lights are crap.
negative,"Description says that these would fit a Hyundai Tucson. Not true. Even after cutting, these mats are so large and out of shape that the deep cup shape where liquids or snow are supposed to get trapped just folds and so the purpose gets defeated.<br />It is important for the description to be more accurate.  I don't know if I will try to return because of the false description because I cut these already. Waste of money.<br />These will definitely fit a large truck. My big issue is with the sellers saying it will fit my vehicle and this is just not true."
positive,"This is a great replacement if you have the original that's in bad shape, but the key is still good.<br />This unit comes apart easily, original fob pretty much needs to be destroyed to gain access to battery circuitry and sensor, asking with key.<br />Then you can transplant original inner components to this fob.<br />I had to use original key keeper pin also, as the new one supplied with this fob was to tight to go thru key and work correctly. After it was all reassembled it's worked perfectly and a far cry cheaper than replacement from Kia!!"
positive,They are being used in the car and the bike just what I needed.
positive,"Bough this product to try it out in comparison to Bug Slide and it does ok.<br />I prefer bug slide over this, but this product is fine.  It leaves a bit of a streak if you use too much"
positive,Looks good
positive,"I've had these on my car for quite a while now. Some are peeling only because I'm terrible at placing stickers. Most are still there, dirt and all. I love these so much."
negative,Out of the four bulbs only one worked and it was very dim.
positive,Did a great job on my work shoes. Performed as claimed.
positive,"07 Ranger, 6' bed. Fit perfect and easy to put on."
positive,Everything came with the kit to install
positive,Fit 2005 F250 single alternator no problem...appears to be a sturdy belt very similar to factory one.  Will purchase again if needed
positive,I purchased this mitt to clean my new car. It is well made and works very well. I have a ceramic coating on my car and use premium car washing products.  This is the perfect mitt to wash your car safely and thoroughly.
positive,Received on time as advertise.  Works well.
negative,This item is horrible.  Doesn’t have enough power to turn a car or motorcycle over and start.  Doesn’t charge either.  Not sure why a company would make this or amazon sell it
positive,"When a chance the mirror  i do not think it will be ok, but it was excellent, not diferences from the original, the visio is super like the another before . The same item selected, on time"
negative,"I have several Thule products that do a good job for me, so I bought this with confident expectations.  I was soon let down in many ways.<br />+ The straps were sometimes hard to pull into a useful position to secure the bike, and due to poorly designed ends sometimes nearly impossible to release with even slightly sweaty hands.  Worse, the anti-sway does not work at all without the strap (cheap plastic parts pulled apart at joints due to poor design and worse material selection, in this Mechanical Engineer's experienced opinion) and if you use the crude strap you've made an already cumbersome even more so even before you figure out what to do with 6 feet of extra strap (if you only mounted one bike)!<br /><br />Yes, it is light.  Yes, it is Aero.  Yes, it is expensive (!) and Yes, my 15 year old Yakima rack still does a much better job despite its weight, etc.  The new uber-rack has been returned for refund."
positive,I use it to cover small cracks on the fiberglass parts of my motorhome.  I mainly want to keep water out until I can get it repaired.  This should do it.
positive,"Great product and fair price , just happy that you have it all the time and delivery took awhile but we knew<br />we would get specially during Covid-19 !! Thank you"
positive,I installed this 12 months ago and so far no leaks. I think it's held up long enough to say it's worth it in my mazda 3.
negative,"It is not one of the best, but it gets the job done. If you want a quality product, then go with the 3M"
positive,I'm ASE certified auto mechanic with 30yrs of experience.<br />In short. These brake rotors and carbon pads are superior to your standard brake replacement parts.<br />Metallurgy and design of the rotors reduce warping and heat glazing. Carbon pads handle higher braking temps  and reduced brake dust. Price point is very reasonable to quality and performance.
positive,"Purchased in 2010, lasted till about 2016 and totally useless two years later in 2018. Can't really complain as it stayed on the bike through numerous snow storms and hurricanes. Buying a replacement and can only hope it's as good as or better than than the first one."
negative,Lasted only a year. Medal and welds were so cracked I almost lost my tire! Thankfully I didn't lose my spare tire going down the road. VERY POOR PRODUCT!
positive,"Great product, especially for high-temperature applications."
positive,So Far doing Great.<br />This  fit my 1998 Chevy Tahoe 350 5.7 L SBC perfectly.<br />I would of given a 5 star. But it does NOT have the Alinement mark at the bottom of the shaft.<br />But there are many other ways to aline prior to your 1st drop.<br />The hold down clamp is super tight for a reason this sets your timing perfectly. Hold the distributor in hand Aline the clamp on the right spot for your engine TAP the clamp with a hammer & it will slip on.<br />Not getting any misfire codes and truck is running smooth. I would buy again or recommend to a friend.
positive,Good quality yellow bulbs at a great price. No need to buy PIAA bulbs at 15x's the price! Long lasting bulbs too.
positive,Good quality and perfect fitament
positive,Great product. They work just as described. I use them to trailer my 400 lb Suzuki SV 650
positive,Great upgrade part.
positive,Great
positive,"Someone mentioned staples, but they're on the bottom and you can't see them.  Riding is 3 times more comfortable now.  I didn't realize how much my neck and shoulders bothered me not being able to lean back.  Imagine no back rest in your car's seat.....yuck!  It was VERY easy to install.  It mounts where your strap mounts and has about an inch of adjustment fwd and back."
positive,"Perfect fit, 30 second install"
positive,Had these on my car for about 3 weeks now and seem to be doing a great job considering the pot holes I could not avoid.  Nice and tight ride and seem to be performing up to par.  They were also a perfect fit and a great price.
positive,Great for tires and vinyl interior surfaces such as dash boards.
positive,This was a perfect fit for my 2007 Infiniti FX35.. and a fraction of the price of a new unit from the dealer.  This actually feels like a better quality version of the OEM one from the dealer.  Highly recommended!
negative,"The light is fine, except for the additional pieces (parts)that are used to install  it are very cheap and flimsy."
positive,If you own a trailer or motor home and it has a black tank you want to own this!  Works awesome and it allows you to see what’s all coming out but more importantly when the flush is clear water.  You will be amazed and after you do the back flush which this allows how much more junk was still in your tank.  Easy to use it just takes a little longer...  Hook up the water hose to it and let it back fill your black tank and let it rip you will be shocked how much more junk comes out!
positive,I bought these as a repacment for my old led turn signals after i low sided they work well and havent had any problems with them they are also easy to wire
positive,I was pleasantly pleased with these! Definitely exceded my expectations for the lower price!!<br /><br />Very thick and heavy duty (heavy in weight too)<br />Nice clean lines - everything looked as it should<br />Nice product packaging too!<br />I purchased these as a gift and they loved them!<br /><br />Very happy - would recommend
positive,"This is GREAT!!!  I bought for the extra jumping power and yet, I've used the air compressor several times already.  Very solid, sturdy machine that I keep in the trunk even though I have an auto service.  This beats waiting around for quick, simple trouble."
negative,"OK, so after some 15 years of seeing my car chew through ultra bright H7 headlight bulbs like there is no tomorrow (mostly the Sylvania Silverstar Ultra, typical life span 4 to 6 months), I decided to do a test. Purchased a double-pack these Nighthawk Platinums and a double pack of the Sylvania Silverstar Ultra H7 bulbs, and installed one of each in the car the same day. 2001 BMW 325i, no daytime running lights, but I switch on the headlights nearly 100% of the time. I did see no discernible difference in brightness or color, neither looking at the headlights from the outside, nor looking out onto the illuminated road at night. Now, they have both failed, and here are the results:<br />Sylvania Silverstar Ultra lasted for 166 days/3806 miles.<br />The GE Nighthawk Platinum lasted for 123 days/2963 miles.<br />That's a 28% advantage for the Sylvania over the GE based on miles driven (and a 35% advantage based on days, but that's probably less meaningful). Now the second set of bulbs is installed with the positions switched (driver/passenger). Let's see if the result is reproducible. I'll edit my review when the data is in.<br />DAD of 2 boys"
negative,"It's an universal cat, so don't expect it to fit perfectly, the SEL did go off. used it for an 2005 chevy Astro Van, lot's of adaptations. it's leaking a little air but that is my mechanic crap work's fault."
positive,worked nicely
positive,"Perfect in every way! Size, shape, firmness, sleeping comfort & overall quality are exceptionally good!"
negative,The instructions are in Chinese only.
negative,"Shipping speed is a lie. They took nearly a week to get here, even with one day prime. Brightness is fair, easy of installation was why I kept them."
positive,fit like a charm. a little longer than originals but just a little. came with dielectric grease. good price.
positive,"Great little tool! It only took a minute or two for the driver to install, then it worked like a charm. I have used this on two different laptops with the same great results. I can point the remote at my laptop from anywhere in the classroom and it works."
positive,Battery arrived on time.  I installed it in my scooter and it works fine.
positive,second life for remote!
positive,Easy to install.  Fit well.
negative,I received only 2 pieces instead of 4
positive,Just what was needed to complete the job
positive,Seals very well
positive,Perfect fit for my Honda Accord 2005
negative,"Great in theory and will come through in a pinch but… Let’s just call it what it is-? Foldable soft sided bucket!! Translation: it is an inverted scoop shape item that can “in theory contain water!!”<br /><br />Look at my included photos… You will see how compact this can be- I consider that a perk! Especially, if needed to fit into tight space for storage. But, if you also view the photos… You’ll see, the outer brim does not like to hold it shape, at least when it’s empty of water! Where I run into trouble.. was moving the filled bucket from point A to B- I don’t recommend! This is best field where one plans to use- when lifting the handles when full.. the brim does bend and shape shift!<br /><br />Now, where I do see this coming in handy is, when transporting something that may leak liquid or, where you need impromptu ability to hold any amount of liquid (up to 3gallons -.5 for sloshing!) this can step up.<br />I see this being great for camping, a day at the beach… Or, left in a car for any of those unexpected moments. Otherwise, i’d suggest a real bucket if wanting to wash the car or, hood fish, fetch a pail of water ha ha.. things that need you will need to depend on more sturdy security!<br /><br />The price point of under $10 its spot on!! So, I don’t think anyone would be truly disappointed with what this can offer you. But, for my specific need- car wash “bucket” it’s not the ideal solution. I hope this info can help your decision.. feel free to let me know!"
positive,exactly as expected
positive,Great!
positive,Very heavy & solid rubber.  These work great.  Cheaper at Harbor Freight though.  (I paid $12 on Amazon)
positive,"The sweet summer breeze is a fruity smell that isn't giving me a headache like many other perfumes/scents do.<br /><br />I'm trying to rid a van of smoke and this has taken its place. I still smell smoke on the seats if I put my nose right up to them but otherwise I'm pretty impressed. It's only been a day though.<br /><br />Update: It's been about 3 weeks and the summer breeze scent is pretty faint and I can smell a bit of smoke coming back. The van has been outside in spring, temps ranging 60-80 degrees."
positive,"Decided to pass on the dealership's $100 charge to install this filter. Filter is  manufacturer grade, fit perfectly and was easy to change."
negative,"The description noted that this item fits a 2"" receiver hitch. It certainly can be inserted, but is too small to fit snugly. It rattles around and doesn't sit level. I am returning this item and looking for a better product."
positive,Nice
positive,"Got it for my 2004 Harley Fatboy, Quick plug in and I was back on the road.  The light is brighter than stock I had and much better protected.<br /><br />Works Great!"
positive,"The connectors are horrible, insulation slips around too much, other than that everything else is top notch"
positive,i bought this for our vehicle.  I like it a lot.  It is the right size for a vehicle and I have used it in two places - behind the passengers seat and behind the middle arm rest of the SUV.  Either place works well.  I would recommend it.
negative,I honestly expected to send to last longer. As everyone has typically indicated may be about a week.
positive,"These fit my 2011 Toyota 4Runner perfectly. They are much more rugged/beefy than I expected. These are going to be perfect for this coming winter, having a deep edge to contain the snow and mud."
negative,No sirvió para jeep Grand Cherokee 2011
positive,Need to send several different sizes the one on the door handle is a lot fatter and the ones on latch are smaller
positive,works great for repairing tile.
positive,"Simple tool, same design for years. Good price, quick shipping."
positive,Perfect for my trailer!
positive,Exactly what I expected...would order again!
positive,added more power ports to my rig for accessories.
positive,Easy to install.  Professional appearance.
positive,been a great tool thus far
positive,Looks awesome and works perfectly.
negative,It hasn't even been 24 hours and the actuators stopped working. It was a total pain to install (I have a small car) so now I have to take it ALL out to return/exchange it??<br />Don't waste your time and money; buy the more expensive kit.
negative,Average quality and cheap metal ring but the looks are pretty good.  For the price it's to be expected.  I had to take it apart to drill a hole bigger to be able to adjust the voltage reading.
positive,Fits my 2006 Craftsman T1000 perfect.
negative,"If you're putting this on an XR650L, I'd recommend a fritzco sprocket.  These are fairly good but will mount a bit offset causing excessive chain/sprocket wear.  I ran this for a while before dumping it.<br /><br />I suppose it works, in a pinch.. and it's better than the OEM thinner sprocket which will wear the countershaft excessively."
positive,Real good replacement for the earnest tray twist lock socket wracks.
negative,"This had a distinctly velvet texture which is nice when the wheel turns one way but very grabby and unpleasant going to other way.  Was difficult to get on, but did come off easily."
positive,"I ordered and quickly received the CJH FAMILY Digital Tire Gauge.  The tire gauge was sent in a shipping cardboard box shipped with additional items I ordered.  These were protected by bubble wrap and delivered by the UPS.  The product packaging was nice and informative.  The Digital Tire gauge is designed to comfortably fits your hand and features a soft, non-slip surface for sure grip. There is a really nice lighted nozzle and display screen for ultimate visibility in low light or at night. This Tire Gauge also features a back light that will help you read the pressure in dim or dark areas.  I also like the automatic shut down.  Overall, this is a great quality product, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for a good tire gauge. I'm sure it will bring me many years of service.<br /><br />I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.

negative,The extension collapses as you use it. Very frustrating. The idea is great especially paired with the step that hooks into your door. But the quality is lacking.
positive,Fits and works perfectly! Directions came with it too!
positive,:)
positive,"After 3 car covers later, I found the one! Fit my car perfectly, I paid more but you get what you pay for. Thank you, 🙏"
positive,Bought this for our '97 TJ and new boot.  Works like it should.  Easy to install.
positive,Couldn't tell them apart from the actual Harley daymakers.  You can definitely tell the difference between these and the stock lights. These were put on my 2014 Road King.
positive,"Great product, great fit."
positive,It looks nice and easy to put on but I think I could Break the lock with out much trouble. With that said it will keep most people out.
positive,Works great and is amazing for Hauling anything on the bed of a truck. Driving a Dodge 2500 Power Wagon and it fits great.
positive,Fast shipping and product as described.
positive,Easy to install
positive,"This kit fit well.  It comes with pretty much everything in the photo.  It comes with a new idle mix screw and spring, but I recommend using the old spring.  The new spring is new so its longer and stronger.  That makes getting the tiny washer and o-ring back in properly a bit of a chore.  The spring doesn't do anything except act as a locknut anyway.  The irony is that in most cases, the kit isn't actually required because the gaskets are reusable.  However, if the old gaskets are allowed to dry out, they will need to be soaked in gasoline to soften them up before reinstalling or else they will leak.  The bottom line is that this is a good kit, you don't always need them to rebuild this carb.  Don't forget that if you do rebuild that you could need two kits  - one for each carb."
positive,"AWESOME PRODUCT, SUPERFAST SHIPPING !!!! THANKS A MIL....."
positive,Good product. I didn't realize it adheres to the outside of the window. It makes squeegee-ing the window without scraping the sticker a pain.
positive,Just got it. Tried it. Works well. Seems accurate. I like that it uses regular AAA batteries instead of those coin types.
positive,"I have a 2019 Subaru Impreza wagon and the trunk it kinda pathetic, lol. I had a trunk organizer but it took up way too much room. I went searching on Amazon for something that can be attached to my back seat. This popped up.<br /><br />I love how it had SO MANY POCKETS of different sizes. I take a lot of crap with me in my car (I like to come OVERPREPARED) so I have napkins, utensils, jumper cables, plastic bags, band aids, etc. I was able to take everything out of the trunk organizer and put it in the pockets. I created enough space to fit 3 more grocery bags for when I go shopping. This thing is awesome! Very easy to install as well."
negative,They only lasted 3 months. The company says they offer a one-year warranty but there is no way to contact them. They are not searchable through Amazon or Google. Basically you can call it a scam.
positive,I was replacing my jump box and not aware of the technology to minimize the size of jumpers. I bought this because of the Amazon ratings and it's very realistic price. I have had battery issues with my Buick and one of my classic cars. The Buick was deader than dead and this little jumper turned it over much faster than it's normal starter and it ran instantly. I had to use it two additional times to get it to the battery shop. Two weeks later my 30 year old Plymouth developed almost identical symptoms with identical results. I have purposefully not re charged it to see if it will hold the charge as advertised. I think it will. The storage case is very well done and good quality as well.
positive,Took care of engine misfire along with new plugs
positive,Solid steel. Easy to use.
positive,perfect.
positive,"Warning, this is not inexpensive but for fit, looks and durability I'm very happy with my purchase. Looks like it was made for my car. Easy to put in and looks great. I'm kicking myself for not ordering this sooner."
negative,Don't buy I ordered this kit and all I received was a beat up box of used looking pads and not a single rotor like it said it would come with
positive,"Love the quality and how snugly it fits, however it was a struggle to get it on.  As long as you have an extra set of hands then you're golden. Nice feel on my hands as I drive."
positive,Hands down the best car soap I've ever used.  The car stays clean for weeks after using this stuff.
positive,I'm more comfortable using an OEM Part for important components like Power Steering.  Made in Canada.
positive,Can't beat this for a hyd leak or power steering my zero turn lower seal for pump was leaking put this it stopped it right away might leak again but two tears running ok .
positive,It was a gift for my brother but I must say he is so happy with how his car looks!
positive,For 2009 FLHTC. Position is a choice thing.<br />These bars fit and finish is very very good. used all stock wiring and a +4 clutch cable to run inside the fairing. With stock cable you can drop straight down from the lever if you want-
positive,Good quality
positive,"Great product, especially for boosted cars via turbo or charger... best for 9-15 psi..."
positive,2nd pair I have owned. Got 5 yrs out of first. Need jack to install as can’t compress coil.
negative,not good for dents
positive,Bought this for and installed it on a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer 4.2L strait 6 113 wheelbase.  The belt was easy to install and works well.  I put 5k miles on the truck since the install and no issues.
positive,"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars across the board is the plastic pieces to secure in place were not tight enough, so my husband used a different method to make them tighter. Look and feel awesome.  Hope they hold up for a long time."
positive,"nothing works better, 10 to 15 mile per gallon better MPG"
positive,Did the job and was easy to use.
positive,As expected
positive,"If your looking for a quick fix for really small leaks, use it. Otherwise do it right and repair the A/C correctly by fixing the leaks(s) with replacement parts."
positive,"smooth, reacts quickly,"
positive,"Purchased this steering wheel cover because my hands would get sore and cramped on long drives (10-12 hours).  Installed pretty easily, &#34;rolled&#34; it on without much trouble (2000 F350).<br /><br />It has taken a little bit to get used to the larger diameter, and the cover is not as soft as I thought it might be, but it seems to be a quality product and I am not sorry I purchased it."
positive,great decal
positive,"I got this fan to replace my existing Maradyne fan that I thought had finally given up after six years.  Turns out the relay was bad.  I installed this fan in the existing hole. It didn't come with the plastic pieces the bolts go through but I was able to reuse the old ones.  I installed a new relay and temp switch rather than sending unit. The fan really moves some air. It's a little noisy but I don't care, I want cooling air. I have a blown sbc in my 41 Willys and with the AC on it can get warm in traffic.  This fan comes on at 190 and drops the temp in a couple minutes just idling.<br /><br />It's a little longer than my original so the motor just clears the ID of my lower blower pulley.  I'm going to cut a half inch out of the fan shroud to give a little more clearance.<br /><br />I'd recommend this fan for any big motor combination.  Do be aware that it can pull about 18 amps so you need a good alternator.<br /><br />I also used 10 ga wire for the fan circuit....I didn't want any voltage drop."
positive,Just what I wanted
positive,These install so easy and work perfect.  I had my license plate sockets corrode out on me so i just wired these in their place and used a bunch of di-electric grease in the socket and around the wire entrance spots.  Also replaced the standard bulbs with leds.  Simple cheap easy fix.  The dealer wanted over $40 to do this.  Took me 10 mins and some heat tube and grease and saved myself a good $35 bucks
positive,"These look very nice in the car, I love the red accent around the edge. It's just enough to add a pop of color."
positive,Good fit easy install.
positive,Fit as expected!
negative,first the rivet tools dont even fit and the push nut is to small you can pull it out so even if the pins fit the push screw doesnt you most definitely get what you pay for and worse is i cant even return or exchange it
positive,Great
positive,Great transaction and quality product
positive,"I originally purchased a non-OEM fuel cap for my Silverado.  I've been fighting an intermittent ""check engine"" light and ""tighten fuel cap"" messages ever since then.  Pay a little extra, stick with the OEM.<br /><br />The retainer cord fitting snaps right into the hole in the fascia piece, no tools required."
positive,"I had few dent in my car, so i been looking for a set and found out this kit that have everything i needed. Upon checking the kit and using it the quailty of the kit was great and it was easy to use. Overall if you are looking for one set than this is the one."
positive,A little bulky but works
negative,Does not fit a 2014 ram 1500 like advertised
positive,"The top of the bottle wasn't tightened and the contents spilled out. Contacted seller, and it was replaced with no problem, the seller was great about it.<br /><br />The product goes on easy & comes off easy. It leaves a hard, smooth surface, with a brilliant shine. There are instructions & tips for application, it's best to follow them. The car looks great. I would buy again!"
positive,After doing my research I came up with this part number. Worked like a champ.
positive,Works great in dusty racing conditions. Makes the helmet fan much more effective and keeps dust out of my eyes. It's a little pricey for what it is...
negative,"They would not stay in place. They look good and would have wiped clean easily however, they did not  lay in position “ sizing is a little off” much less adhere properly"
negative,Attempted to install on 94 Corolla 1.6l manual but center shaft is too wide and would not fit into engine mount bracket. Had to go to store to purchase after the original was taken out
positive,"It looks nice, but it's a bit too large for my 2008 Toyota Corolla. I couldn't get the tabs behind the car seat to fasten in place, which would make this a problem if I had back seat passengers, but I don't. I will probably replace this at some point, but for the time being, it works as a good looking protectant for putting groceries and baggs on."
positive,"works perfect , snaps right into place"
negative,I haven't had to use this yet- but I know that I'll have whatever size I need once the tubing comes for my room dehumidifier that needs tubing to reach the drain in the area.
positive,This product is amazing!! I (unsuccessfully) tried all types of cleaners to remove some very stubborn sunscreen reside from my car upholstery. Car Guys cleaner removed it all easily and it looks like new!! And they included a microfiber towel that works on your car leather and computer screens! Car Guys rock!
positive,you can really tell the difference.  I used it on one side of my hood and compared it.  It is a micro dirt magnet.
positive,"This tail light is an excellent OEM spec replacement for the driver's side tail light. It matches my other tail light exactly and the fit was exactly the same.<br /><br />My tail light was broken in a hit and run and ordering this tail light provided me with everything I needed to replace the housing and lenses. BE AWARE, this tail light is the housing and lenses only. It does not come with the actual bulbs that emit the light. Thankfully, I had all the bulbs in my old broken tail light. They were all still working and usable in this replacement housing. They simply twist out and twist into the new housing.<br /><br />The title of the video that I followed on youtube to help replace my tail light is: MAZDA RX8 tail rear lights condensation fix naprawa parujacych lamp<br /><br />To summarize the video:<br /><br />You need to remove 4 or 5 plastic clips in the trunk area. This will free up the center plastic piece where the trunk latches. You can pull this out by pulling up on it. Once this piece of plastic is removed the trunk liner will be exposed and can be slightly moved to expose the electricals for the tail lights. You simply disconnect all of the plugs going to the tail light, remove two 10mm nuts that hold the tail light in, and push up on a plastic tab in the center of the tail light and the whole housing should pop out.<br /><br />Make sure to clean the metal where the gasket will touch and that no dirt is present. You will want a good seal here or water will leak into your taillight housing. This is a common problem for the RX8 and there are many videos out there that will show you how to use silicone to fill in leaky areas of an older gasket.<br /><br />I have included photos of the tail light installed close up as well as one showing both tail lights so you can see how well they match up.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*OEM perfect fit<br />*Crystal clear lenses<br /><br />Cons:<br />*None<br /><br />Additional Considerations:<br />Make sure you have the bulbs you need in order make use of this tail light housing<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars (&#62;=.5 rounds up, &#60;.5 rounds down) =&#62; 5 stars<br /><br />If you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."
positive,very inexpensive & seems to be of high quality.  time will tell.
positive,"this one does work with my 2011 Buick Regal auto mode. it has been a week, so far so good."
positive,"I love the looks of these! Reminds me of the cars from the 50s and such. Makes the car look like its floating down the highway. Install was nice and easy, just a matter of removing old hub caps and lining up the hole for the valve stem. and pushing them onto the wheel."
positive,I've had mine for over 2 years now and it's still in great condition. I can only imagine what my actual steering wheel would look like without this cover. Easy to wipe clean and none of the stitching has come apart or freyrd. Looks great and lasts forever. Great price too!
negative,"We got less than a year and a half out of the 4.0Ah battery that came with the Ego 20in mower. (Purchased Mar 2016, and it failed last summer) It will no longer hold a full charge, despite having a full green bar, and lasts maybe 8-10 minutes in the mower. The replacement batteries are expensive enough that it may be cheaper just to buy a complete new mower than to replace the battery."
positive,todo bien
positive,"This is a damn good vest, and mostly well thought out. My only complaint is that the built-in holsters are only meant for bigger guns, and any moderately heavy gun makes this vest feel completely off. Need a counter-weight in the other side. That being said, I carry a full-size 1911 in my left side and three magazines in the other."
positive,"Very nice, works as advertised although I used a Marine grade rocker switch panel instead of the supplied rocker switch."
positive,"great item!  Son gave it to his dad and it is a great  clever item to have!  YOu can put nails, etc it in an they will not spill out!!!"
positive,"This worked very well.  Never touched my propane.  heat up time took a bit but if you fire it up during setup, you are good to go!"
positive,MUCH BETTER than the Raider plastic unit.  I have 5 of these units and they are well past the 3rd year with no problems.  A little lube or grease makes it work better.  I would say a 2 second on-off is realistic.  IT IS WORTH EVERY CENT!
positive,this did the trick and fixed my check engine light on my HHR and was a lot cheaper than the dealer price.
positive,Did what it was supposed to.
positive,"These are not amazing but for the price they do what I need. They are a flood light. They send light out almost 180* which is good for what I need. In the woods and trails they light everything within maybe 80ft including up in the trees and to both sides. If you need something to punch out and light the road way out for high speed stuff this is not your solution.<br />The first set I got fogged up on me. I tried to take the lens off and reseal it and but the light would only come on half way after that. with how cheap they are, I just got a second set and replaced the one that was dead. The new one next to the old one showed how much the black had faded in only a few months.<br />They are what they are. Cheap. They make a bunch of light and look good to my eye so they are good..ish."
positive,Works well.  Had purchased another brand before but those were loud and squeaked.  These Bosch branded ones are nice and quiet.
positive,as expected
negative,"For what they are, and the gimmicky tool they attach to, they are WAY too expensive."
positive,The real thing but expensive. You can use an American alternative if you are not in a hurry to find one
positive,Softer ride than stock.  Took about 30 min to install.
positive,the price was the best I found for my needs - the carpet is the right width for covering trailer bunks and is easy to work with.  Time will tell how durable it is.
positive,"These works very well with my 2006 Ford F150 XLT (2-WD) truck.  I kept getting the engine light on my truck, was able to get fault code and not only that, I was able to actually look at the value from the sensor to determine that the truck was lying to me.  I reset the code and continued to watch the sensor.  After about 15 minutes of driving the light came back on, I looked and saw it was the same fault code, but the sensor was reading fine.<br /><br />Maybe it's an intermittent fault and I'll need to set up a trend on the torque app to see if it drops out.<br /><br />Works very well, syncs easily with my Samsung Galaxy Note 4."
positive,The part works great!  thank you so much
negative,"Have a 2016 Dodge Ram 1500... or is it just Ram 1500 now?  whatever - and item did not work with the TPMS in our truck.  Tried multiple times (actually have a 2012 ram 1500 also with TPMS sensors that we tried on also) and didn't do anything after putting in a brand new, completely charged 9V battery.  :("
positive,Happy
positive,"I love this case because I was always wrong the cables in the would get Smashed in my car. Great pocket for cables, and chargers"
negative,"The good news: This light works great so far.<br /><br />The bad news: The one it replaced (same manufacturer and model) failed in less than a year of just sitting there.  The light was brand new on my brand new cargo trailer, just waiting for its first drive.  The failure was some sort of internal disconnect (tapping the light made it flicker but it was otherwise dead)."
negative,"2000 Town and Country Fuel Pump DIY replacement.  Loosened passenger side strap bolts all the way - should have loosened the driver side also.  The original straps broke.  These Dorman straps should have fit, but were a misfit, unless you did some bending at the workbench.  I went with OEM which were a perfect fit.  As advertised, the part numbers should have worked.  The Dorman photos look different than the actual product."
positive,"Bearing appears to be a solid unit. Turns smooth and tight. Since it's not OEM, there are always concerns about durability and longevity but if there are any issues with performance, I will update this review."
positive,Ha.
negative,Did the job
positive,You have a spring to mount or remove - this is the tool for it. Simple - effective.
positive,As described - good to have as back up
positive,we finally found the perfect size to fit our trailer hitch for a pontoon boat. no one had it in stock in the local brick and mortar stores so of course Amazon to the rescue.
negative,"This wiper leaves streaks, smears, and swipes all over my windshield. I can't see anything when it's raining. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I'm in a really good mood overall today."
positive,Works well
positive,Installed easily.
negative,The light are fine but they are not very bright. I'd say they are about half as bright as the incandescent ones.
positive,"So glad I happened to think, &#34;They must make replacememt edging, right - I'll try Amazon!&#34; After I fixed up my missing pieces, the rest of the family hired me to fix their missing pieces and even add some to cars that didn't have any to begin with. And I've STILL got tons left. Score!"
positive,Fit my Triumph Bonneville T120 perfectly. Nut on the end should make removal much easier than OEM.
positive,Very firm but cmfortable. Gives me that extra few inches to help me see as I am short
positive,Did some cross referencing to find this filter. It is for a Caterpillar skid loader. The cabin is enclosed with AC. Dealer is really proud of the OEM filter. Perfect fit and I bought additional ones. The fresh air intake on the skid loader is near the tracks where the most dirt and dust is created while operating the skid loader. May look at adding a snorkel to move fresh air intake higher to extend life of the filter.
negative,"I ordered this security alarm to keep my Ebike safe but I received an obviously used alarm that seems to have been returned by another buyer and shipped again to me by Amazon. When I opened the box, the alarm had several scratches on the plastic as if somebody had forced it open to replace batteries. When I opened the alarm, the alarm had a mix of different brand batteries as if somebody was trying to make this work. I replaced those batteries with NEW Energizer batteries but the alarm does not respond. I will not bother to return this item for a refund due to its cheap price but it is now in my garbage can. I CANNOT recommend this alarm to anyone because you might receive a used, defective alarm like I did. Get an alarm at your local bike shop instead."
positive,"This works like Pledge polish  (which I use to clean our wooden furniture) - cleaning and adding a thin layer of protection, except this is for your car.  And makes your car smell like pina colada."
negative,"A little thicker than maple syrup but I do not feel any less leakage in oil, maybe just a bit? Definitely does not help with the gas mileage if anything it would make it less because it would thicken the oil causing more friction."
positive,We use it in our garage and it was easy to set up and is pretty small. Would recommend to anyone looking to get one of these.
positive,saves time
negative,"I bought these because I really liked the idea of a flashing-then-steady third (middle) brake light. I had no problem installing it, and it worked great while it worked. But unfortunately the first of my 2-pack lasted only about 6 months. I bought it and installed in June 2022 and noticed it wasn't working by January 2023. I'm not sure how long I was driving without a functioning third brake light. Failing after only 6 months is far worse than I expected. I installed the second one and it's working for now."
positive,"I have a 29' rv , they work great"
positive,"Great little setup. Simple to use, great look."
positive,"I had to remove the wheel bearings on my 2015 v-strom 650. This product worked wonderfully without any issue. For those splitting the wedges, you're probably tapping the rod into them too hard. It's a balance but the product does work overall."
positive,"Bought with the 4-bank charger so it would reach all the cars.<br />cable seems durable, and have not had any problems with it."
positive,"This fit in my '96 Jeep Grand Cherokee perfectly. It came with light bulb, which I didn't expect, so that was an added bonus. This made a huge difference as my old one was very yellowed. For this price, you can afford to replace both headlights instead of paying someone to use a rubbing compound to make your headlights look better. If you are buying one of these, you'll probably also want the Passenger Side Lamp: [[ASIN:B00131UW5I Right Passenger Side Headlight Headlamp 93-98 Jeep Grand Cherokee]]"
positive,I like my window decal sticker it is a good size and looks great on my car rear window.  I had a bit of a problem trying to get the small points to come off cleanly even after reading the directions and following them to the letter.  The decal has a mirror finish and you put it on by removing the backing  and placing on clean glass which you spray lightly with water.  You then take a credit card and rub the decal so it sticks and you slowly have to remove the backing.  It was packaged very well.
negative,Spring is too long to hold it against panel
positive,"Other than the obvious grammatical error (is there really no space for &#34;whom&#34; on the magnet?) this magnet conveys a message that resonates with a lot of pet owners we meet.<br /><br />And the magnet continues to hold tight, though we do remove it when going through the car wash, just to be on the safe side."
positive,"Works great on small engines that are hard starting, only takes a minute to pop open the carb (move air filter usually) and spray in to clean the ethanol varnish/gum out. Then vroom.<br />Sure beats yanking on that pull cord 100 times.<br />Also works well to clean paint off of things, but do be careful with overspray, getting in eyes (hurts! yes I'm an idiot), and inhaling fumes.<br />May melt plastics, take off paint and ruin your day if not careful, so be careful. Don't drink this and get IT banned too you idiot! :)"
positive,Someone misjudged a turn and wound up in a snow bank. I was able to drag their car out.
positive,"Great item , price, quality"
positive,Pleased with kit.
positive,"Came in good time, great price for a great oil.  Using in a '91 Toyota pickup and an '05 Prius."
positive,This product worked great for my check engine light on a 96 Chevy s10. Diagnosed the problem and let me clear it since it was nothing serious. Very easy to use and get the code definition. Wish it did the break system as well must’ve over looked that when buying!  Overall very satisfied and looking forward to using it on my other two cars if ever needed. Great tool for a great price.
positive,works as intended
positive,OEM replacement. Old spring seemed fine but why not if I was in there.
negative,Cheap as can be
positive,"Nice, listed life of bulb was a lot shorter than most other bulbs."
positive,I had originally purchased this for our car’s leather upholstery. After watching a how-to video by the Chemical Guys I decided to try on our 15 year old leather sofa. The results were stunning! The sofa looks good as new! Highly recommend this product. Make sure you get the soft horsehair brush to work the cleaner into the leather!
positive,Worked great for our Dodge Durango
positive,I used it as a gas treatment and did great in my car
negative,"Connectivity is PATHETIC.  Bump the switch and it breaks contact. I will search for something better.<br />The mount is awesome, the switch is GARBAGE"
positive,Can you see me now? Good!<br /><br />Beautiful Lights!
positive,I just really like this plate.
negative,Didn’t really make much difference in the size of the cup holder
positive,"Installed four of these on our Gulfstream Amerilite TT and they work beautifully!  Cutting the old jacks off was the only difficult part of installing these jacks.  These jacks are very well built and sturdy.  I installed them at an angle instead of perpendicular as the instruction state because I read that doing so would provide less side to side and/or front to rear movement and that seems to work well.  These jacks cost a little more than some of the jacks sold here on Amazon, but these appear to be build better, although I have not tried the cheaper jacks."
negative,They seemed okay but ended up cracking in between the treads. Still have half the tread remaining but now I have to replace. Bought them in 2016.
positive,"Have been using this in my 2016 Duramax since it was new. Have a little over 60,000 miles and haven’t had any problems. Can’t claim it’s increased my mileage but it hasn’t hurt it. A little pricey but so was my truck."
negative,These &#34;covers&#34; for the screws looked nice in the beginning but they quickly fell off so this was a waste of money
positive,Fast shipping and holders are made of quality and study materials
positive,Save yourself the money of the dealer and buy these. Great deal and work just as good as factory or auto parts store wiper blades
positive,just good
positive,We bought these to load our Rzr into the back of our pick up truck.  They are very light to handle but extremely durable for loading the Rzr. Then they fold up to store underneath it during transparency.
positive,"Great product, quickly install."
positive,"Look great, everything as expected."
positive,Worked great !
positive,Exactly as posted fit right into my 06 Silverado 2500 hd screwed right in
positive,"High-quality product. Although these weren't good for my application (the surface gap is too large), these are the best plugs for older Mercury Outboards. The seller generously accepted my return.<br /><br />Great product and great seller!"
negative,"They work some what but not totally keeping it quiet, and you must use silicone adhesive to hold them in place or you will lose them. I strongly recommend that you adhere them before you install the bar for best results if you were going to use them at all."
positive,Easy to install and does the job!
positive,"Pround and happy to use Aero Cosmetic products. Hands down one of the best out there. I used Tvd products before but lately after a week the trims looks faded with patches, so i decuded to use Aero Cosmetic tire 👗 ing and i was happy with the results aftwr a week. Its not shiny as it says and am fine with that."
positive,Worked for a 2008 Tahoe LTZ 5.3 vin code 0 type LMG was easy to install no need to replace factory mount unless it’s broken
negative,ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE IN THE LISTING.  I have been installing tires for over 40 years.  I don't need to install these before giving a one star review.  If you know tires just look at the pictures.  Supposed to be tubeless.  These are tube type tires marked and sold as tubeless.  The saddest thing is they were actually made in USA.  I'm embarrassed.
positive,"Did the job, plenty of wire."
positive,Excellent
positive,Comes with a carry handle and a bag to store it in. I use it to extend the charge cable to my electric car. Does not get hot at all.  It is a bit heavy but it does coil back easily to store it. If you need 100 feet consider getting to 50 foot because if weight and handling them. My car charges at 32 amps and this cable and charger cable barely got warm.
positive,Easy to use and read. Very solid feel.
positive,"Exact fit, wired my original harness right into the new lights. A fallen tree branch broke my originals, this was a perfect replacement kit."
positive,The blades do not hug the windshield around the outer edges.  This is an important factor that lends to this products performance.
positive,"Had some difficulty putting the brakes into the caliper bracket with the included hardware kit.<br /><br />Consider having a 4"" instead of a 3"" c-clamp on hand, as the corolla caliper piston is thicker than usual."
positive,Good
positive,Used this on a toad trip. It holds my 64oz water container. Not many holders can do tgat
positive,"I recently purchased the FEOFFY RV Adapter 1111 and it has been a great addition to my RV setup. It's easy to install and use, and I've had no issues with it so far. It's also very well made and seems to be quite durable. The price is very reasonable too. I would definitely recommend this adapter for anyone looking for an easy and reliable RV adapter."
positive,"Exact replacement, but made in China."
positive,"Easy to install, provides a good field of vision - but I am concerned whether the construction of the item is sturdy enough to withstand carwashes or any sort of pressure applied on it."
negative,"I seem to have gotten the 1 star top rather than the 5 star top. I've had this on for only month and as others have said it's very loud. At highway speeds it really seems like the whole top is going to fly off! The back bar does not fit all the way in the clips and it rained last night and it's leaking. Over bother the rear door surrounds and over the front passenger door! Wanted a soft top for summer fun driving but now I'll be wasting time trying to fix the leaking areas, not fun. Just missed my return window for this top. Very disappointed!!<br /><br />Update 7-22-17<br />Came out this morning after a heavy rain and the sound bar cover and passenger seat belt were soaked!! Looked at the roof and there's a bigger than a quarter size circle were the damn top has a leak in the seam!! Between this and the back window flapping over 55mph, I've had it with this top! Worse thing I've ever bought!"
positive,I think around the top at the Curve it fit a little too snug so you couldn't screw it in all the way tight without fear of cracking the housing but other than that it's a good-looking piece it's a good shining quality and it did not crack while installing it and it's been on the truck for about a year now still hasn't cracked and I really don't think you can tell it doesn't fit perfect
positive,Good switch
positive,"This does not come with a GB70 ultra-safe Lithium Jump Starter. It's a good case, you could use it for something else, but it's not designed for that!<br /><br />What it is designed for is perfectly storing and holding your GB70. It does that very well. Room for all the cables, and made precisely to hold the main unit. It is robust, and you can almost think of it as insurance. One day you will drop your GB40, you will drop something on it. You know this is going to happen.<br /><br />And this case will protect it very well. So that drop will not matter.<br /><br />The case is very light, but behind that lightness is a sturdy, strong case that will easily deal with drops and thumps. Holding all the bit perfectly in place.<br />I like how it looks - strong, rugged appearance to match a strong, rugged case!"
positive,"We get compliments everywhere we go with this hat, it's definitly a ""keeper""."
positive,Investors 3x the light for f series Fords.
positive,good
positive,Great value!
positive,"Easy to use and does what it needs to do but I question the accuracy of the Guage. I was trying to get my tires to 32 PSI so set that on tue machine. When done though, my car was saying I was at 38. Seems very off. But it is good enough to just have and more convenient that trying to do it at air pumps at the gas station."
positive,"However, the installation was a bit of a pain. The installation screws and clips require that you actually have to pull apart the fender wells."
negative,The Christmas tree plugs they sent me dont actually fit the bumper license plate holes. The holes are larger than the fins on the clips. I can pull them in and out with 1 finger. I ended up glueing them into the hole.
positive,"This thing is amazing. It has completely changed how we approach camping! I LOVE not sleeping on the ground! We took it on its first camping trip to Yosemite in April. I felt way more comfortable being up high. We got SEVERAL people stopping by to check it out, ask questions, etc. It didn't rain very hard but it sprinkled. Nothing got in. Although there was condensation on the inside early in the morning, but that would have probably happened with any tent. All the little pockets are great for stashing stuff. Our little flashlights have magnets on them and we were able to stick them to the support bars across the top. My husband practiced putting it together at home, and after you figure it out, it doesn't take too long to set it up by yourself. We love that it includes the tailgate down, as there is a place to put your shoes, etc so you don't get them on the bed. I can't wait to take it on more camping trips!"
positive,Good quality and value.
positive,"The packaging of this product is first rate, probably cost more than the decal. Came in a long square cardboard box. Inside was a long, very thick, very strong cardboard tube. Inside of that was the rolled decal, instructions, soapy water mix for wet applications,  utility knife and a double edge  squeegee, one side hard plastic, the other side covered with microfiber. The instructions also provided YouTube links for How-To videos.  After watching the videos I decided upon a wet application because I was doing it myself,  although I would recommend that this is a two person job, it just makes a lot easier.  The decal seems to be of high quality and I’m very pleased with the end result, I highly recommend this company ."
positive,These are nice! Was surprised. Will buy more that's for sure.
negative,nice touchup paint
positive,Nice off road LED lights.  Package includes mounting bracket and some mounting hardware. The housings are aluminum and they seem to be heavy duty and well made. Will update pics after install.
positive,"Speed bump broke the rear clip on my STI side skirt , this was a perfect size replacement. Great quality and value, as it comes with many in case I need to do this again.<br /><br />Simply slides into the rocker panel itself, and then you clip it back into the body of the car. 30 second fix! Very happy"
negative,Not much different from the duplicolor type you can buy at autozone.  The picture is old and you don't get the old-style paint.  It's the newer style with the base & clearcoat separated.
positive,I needed this to replace my home alarm that kept signaling low batter.  The last one lasted 9 or so years so I expect this one to also last that long.  Terminals have the exact clips I needed to connect them and it took the wink of an eye to do so.
positive,"This is a great drop in replacement for an old cabin air filter, cheapest on the web<br />No cons, it does what its supposed to do."
positive,Simple enough to use.
positive,"These caps were a perfect fit for the anchor sockets after our inground pool ladders were removed. I only ordered 1 pair just to see if they would fit. Since they did, I ordered another set! Shipping was extremely fast, which was appreciated!"
positive,I like these! Thank you!
positive,Great item
positive,"They stopped selling this in my state about 20 years ago. I was glad to find it on Amazon. Nothing better for cutting grease and grime. Just be sure to use it in a way that it doesn't get soaked into the ground. After it gets loaded up with grease and grime, I pour it into a jar or bottle and drop it off at out city's local toxic waste roundup."
positive,Great replacement reverse bulbs!
positive,Lots of cloths for the money they seem to holdup over time.
positive,Worked a lot better than the cap style filter wrenches. Did great on my 09 Impala.
positive,Effective OBDII splitter
positive,"I bought this one because the descriptions (and videos) claimed it was so easy to install.  I have a 2009 Toyota Camry LE V6. Both mufflers needed to be lowered to get this in, and the bolts were cumbersome. It took U-Haul 1.5 hours to install (as I watched). Other than that, it's NOT an eye sore, and it works great."
positive,It is to convert a ring conector so should come with a rubber ring ir something to secure extra band
negative,Installed worked fine fit perfectly but after two days one of the LED chips burned out. hour install time on infinity had to order new bulbs 3day wait and another hour install maybe just a bad one but didn't take that chance again ordered from different manufacturer no issue over 2 months later
positive,"must have or use terminal set.  used it with my odyssey PC925 battery which didn't come with posts.  You will want to use this in cases you're using it in an automotive application, high quality and easy to install."
positive,Very heavy duty! This clamp looks great on my Suzuki S40 holding an HD screaming eagle muffler slip on. Its wide and the pipe is leak free. Love this clamp.
positive,Received on time.  As advertised.  I mounted it on the rear door of my car.
positive,These have just the right amount of bling. Not gaudy
positive,"Easy to install if you let it set in the hot sun for a couple of hours, if not forget it  !"
negative,"Just got mine which shipped from isaddle via amazon prime.  Plugged it into my 2012 Subaru WRX with Torque app on my phone guessed the pin code of 1234 and it connected although it took a while.  Within 3 minutes of my usual commute to work my car shut off while I was going 50mph and stepped on the clutch to move to 5th gear on a busy road. ?!!@!@  I was able to start the car while coasting and continue but I noticed sudden jerkiness when I would step on the gas and when I put the clutch in the RPMS would drop down to almost nothing and it would quickly recover.  At this point I pulled it out of the OBDII port and bam issues gone..  My car has NEVER stalled while moving before, it has to have been from this device.  So.. be warned.. in my case for my car this thing is dangerous... I would recommend anyone who buys this thing tests it out on safe roads for a while."
positive,It works
positive,Quality product and easy to install
positive,"One of my hydraulic lifts for the back gate on my 2017 Jeep Patriot broke, so I got these to replace the old ones. I put it off for a while, thinking it would be tough to do. It couldn’t have been easier! I was done replacing both sides in 10 minutes, and haven’t had a problem with the new ones since!"
positive,"fast delivery great case and all, kind of wish though the tool was more sturdier it's flimsy or I am using them to hard, hmmm"
positive,Good for night riding
positive,"As described, fits perfectly on my 2007 Honda, would buy again"
positive,"The Honda dealor wanted an outrageous price to replace the actuator on my 2003 CR-V.  I couldn't believe the price I bought this for on Amazon, very reasonable.  I had a private mechanic put it on for me.  Now my door locks work just like new. Thanks Amazon."
positive,Purchased for a 2000 Fleetwood Discovery with Velvac mirrors (passenger side) and these fit 100% perfect!  Here's the link for drivers side although they do not include the tiny allen head caps like this set does. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OA7ZUFO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
positive,Perfect for back pain when you are driving over 10 hours a day
positive,"easy out...easy in. No more dead lifting hood on 2008 Suzuki XL-7. Same body as Vue, Torrent, & Equinox"
positive,"This product is very high quality and works exactly as described.  I got the aqua and it was lighter than I was expecting, I was hoping for a deep turquoise.  However I will still keep it.  It is a very handy and useful design."
positive,"Descent matts I used them in my 2013 Chevy Silverado. the fit was good , a little smaller than factory but acceptable."
negative,This blower makes a high pitched sound at all speeds. It is annoying to me but I am also very particular.  The average person may not care.  This is definitely not OEM quality.  For the price I expected better.  Fit and function is good otherwise.
positive,Love these car seat covers. I had my other ones FOREVER!!!! They didn't start fading from the sun until the last couple of years. But it didn't matter to me. I still loved them anyway. The only reason I'm buying more is because someone stole them. I hope they're getting good use too!
positive,Good tire repair plugs!
positive,"This is one of the best items I have ever purchased. Why? I am vertically challenged at 5'0' tall woman, and all seat belts end up right across my neck, so I am constantly wrestling with them just to keep comfortable. After having surgery due to breast cancer, even having the belt across my chest was uncomfortable, so I decided to try this, and I am very happy to say that I can now finally wear a seat belt comfortably!<br /><br />The adjuster is well made, and very easy to use. I have found that you unsnap it, with the straight part at the bottom, and the rounded part at the top, just thread the seat belt into the largest opening, and the metal part of the seat belt goes through the smallest opening, and then into the buckle part of the seat belt. Here's the part that makes it work: the part of the belt that goes across your lap will be at the bottom of the adjuster, and the belt part that goes across your chest will be at the top rounded portion of the adjuster. Snap the adjuster so that the two are separated by the snap. Now you can move it to adjust until you are comfortable and the belt is off your neck. Also, I am able to leave it on my seat belt when I get in and out of the car by just letting the seat belt go back to almost the beginning position."
positive,they make a grate tool that works
positive,Just as expected.
positive,I use a solar panel to keep my lawn mower fully charged and need added length. These were the answer great quality and a prefect fit for what I needed.
positive,"At first we weren’t sure about the size, we figured if it’s too small we’ll just store it in the back of my Camry but the size is perfect for my husband ram1500. Super convenient for storing, Especially for groceries."
positive,Wasn't exactly sure that this was going to fix my problem but was very pleased when it did.  The old unit must have had a leak path that was not easily detected except for the coolant that was blown all over the engine block.  Installed this part and everything is working as it should again.
positive,"This is a good set for a decent price.  It fit really well my vehicle.  The front was easy to slide in and out (to clean).  The driver side, you remove the standard mat then snap the Gator in place.  Looks good quality- my wife liked it.<br /><br />The rear piece covers well the full back with just a small space not covered- way back under the seat.  It fits very tight and snug and therefore takes some work to pull it out to clean it.  It's doable, of course, but more effort than I would have liked.  My kids track dirt from horses and outdoor activities.  So, I put my old square rubber mats- they look like boot trays- over the backseat Gator insert because it's just easier to remove them to wash off than the whole Gator thing.<br /><br />Overall, it looks nice."
positive,"I paired this with a set of new hella sharptones and the plug and play cable from subispeed. I didn't be happier with the look.<br /><br />Installing was a breeze once the bumper is removed. I'd recommend putting a throw blanket down to avoid scratching to the bottom of you bumper cover.<br /><br />If you're wanting different color horns know that you can remove the casing from hella horns, paint them, then reassemble for the desired look."
negative,"Not very powerful, doesn't move much air.."
positive,I'm a Bosch guy through and through.  I've only recently bought the ICON wipers for 3 separate vehicles and they are always easy to install and super reliable.  They're great for all weather especially the winter.  Can't be beat!
positive,"Most of the time this stays flattened in my car. It's easy to deploy into full size with just a hand (important for those juggling people with their hands always full), the bottom has velcro strips that hold to the carpet in the back, and they are awesome for holding small things like groceries or important things like jumper cables and first aid kits."
positive,"[[VIDEOID:9d0771fd1072ccc25af180cdfb536c85]] WARNING: You MUST HAVE have a mini vci cable and techstream software OR to have a Toyota dealer register the remote start ECU after you install it. This is not 100% DIY without one of those 2 things.<br /><br />I have a firmware v2.0.4 mini vci cable and Toyota techstream software so I was able to register the module myself at home.<br /><br />Install was ok, I used the Toyota install guide provided to their technicians. It was a PDF online. Working under the dash is always a pain.  Installed it and connected the 1P connector to initiate the registration. Then used techstream to register the module.<br /><br />It worked immediately afterwards as seen in the video and is the OEM kit, without the worry of some aftermarket garbage causing a no start condition as those shady units typically do when they tie into the ignition. Included all hardware and even the Toyota VIP Remote Engine start window stickers."
positive,"Installed easily. Looks good. Took me two beers to install this mount. Good Mount for winch, beers were just as good."
negative,"I purchased this 2-pack of cartridges to use with a mini-grease gun. The cartridges are 6"" long and contain 4 1/2"" of grease. They fit into my mini-grease gun perfectly. I have no idea where this grease originated. The container indicates that it is distributed by an outfit in St. Louis but the origin is not disclosed. For this reason I will not buy anymore of these when the grease runs out. I prefer to do business with companies that do not hide information. I try to avoid purchases from countries that include harmful chemicals in their products. Hiding information is the main reason for the 3 star rating.<br /><br />The one helpful aid that could be provided is a pull-tab to pull out the covering over the grease so that is will flow into the gun. The way it is set up now is to poke a hole into the covering and then try to find it and fish it out of the spurting grease. A simple pull-tab would make this a much easier task. It is no big thing but just a helpful hint."
negative,My fault. Thought it was a real alarm
positive,The bulbs were easy to install and are definitely bright. I had a pair for a 97 ram 1500 and didn’t have any issues. I got a second set for a 07 ram 1500 and had issues with them turning on for 30 seconds and then turning off. A set of load resistors fixed the issue. They work great now.
positive,Works great. Can't wait to take camping.
positive,"After my 1st order of this cover didn't show, amazon rushed another cover to me via UPS no charge. Thank you amazon. Received 2nd order in 2 days, and it originated in Washington state. Got cover on, and it has survived everything nw ohio winters can throw at it so far. The cover at 1st glance seemed very thin, but the material is apparently strong. I was sure to protect cover from sharp edges around bottom corners of trailer, items on roof, and rain spouts on top corners. I've seen other covers rip in them locations. If you don't protect from sharp objects, any cover is gonna rip. For the rain spouts I cut some wet noodles (the floaty noodles for pools) and taped them over the spouts. I used bubble wrap on the bottom corners and tv antenna on roof. My only complaint for this cover would be the straps you run across the bottom. they like to loosen in time after being whipped around by the wind. After a freezing rain episode, the weight of the ice on 1 side of cover allowed for movement because straps loosened, and the cover slid off center. I have just made an effort to check them every now and then for tightness, but if its not at your home that could be more troublesome for others."
negative,"Had to us BOTH sticky gel pads to get this to stay on my dash, and the gel pads come separately, so when I opened the box, found this, and some stupid little plastic sticker I thought that was the whole thing, and it didn't stay up at ALL. After finally getting it to stick with both gel pads, I do find this useful. You can not move it around repeatedly like you can with a suction version of this, so be very sure you put it where you want it. The magnet on this is amazing. I put the phone magnet loose inside my phone's case and it still works, and works well THROUGH the case. I found that pretty impressive."
positive,It fit well and stopped the leak I had at the oil cooler on my 3.5 liter engine
positive,Every parent needs these. These are great for day to day driving to keep my kids shoes off my seats. I use the storage pockets for longer trips to hold the kindle or iPad.
positive,Quick little tool that beats the penny test. Was already able to notice how one of my front tires was overinflated because of the tread wear markings found via this tool
positive,This is great and just what i needed. I can now make my can look nice and clean and give it the attention it needs. I can do it in my own time and as much as is needed. It is so much more cost effective for my family. It is also a.way for my boys to learn to detail that is something they have wanted to try for some time now. This set is great the pieces are good quality and work great. They do a good job of making my car look shiny and clean. I am very pleased with this set it is exactly what I needed.<br />I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review.
positive,"Great little device.  Well engineered, and almost a little sexy.  Was able to charge 2 phones and use my tablet on the road."
negative,awesome headlights...till they ain’t. Just a couple months out of warranty and just in time for winter the heaters failed. Sent a email to jw speaker about getting them repaired and was told they are not serviceable or repairable... JUNK HEADLIGHTS AVOID!!
positive,Good fit .
negative,Very small and doesn't hold it's shape well.
positive,Nice little gauge.  Accuracy is very good compared to my flukd 179 but ymmv.
negative,"It didn't last long,,,way less than warranty"
positive,"Fits perfectly.  Very practical, especially on road trips."
negative,Looks nice but the fabric makes me sweat and I could not use the backseat cover it did not work nor did I care for the headrest covers.  I should have returned it.
positive,Easy to set up and use.
negative,The description and picture say ETL listed but what I received has no such markings just a blank rectangle on both connectors where the picture says ETL.
negative,"Disappointed that there were no caps for the spout, that’s why I purchased them."
positive,These were a gift. She loved them. Very fancy box it came in. Sent with care! Thank you!
positive,"These gap fillers are well made and unobtrusive looking. On my car the seat cushion is closer to the console at the front than at the rear.  So the fillers are a very tight fit at the front and leave a 1/2 gap at the rear by the seat belt latch.  They sometimes slip a little when the seats are moved forrward or back very far.  Still they are great at stopping dropped keys, credit cards, and food bits from sneaking down into oblivion."
positive,Great to able to reach & connect to read tire pressure.
positive,I love everything about it
negative,As you can see from the photographs this cover doesn’t fit a 1970 Chevy Impala as advertised. The cover is so tight that it will not even go over the front bumper. Be very cautious when ordering for your vehicle. Measure your vehicle first! I learned the hard way. Hopefully this will protect the flat surfaces until the new garage is completed.
positive,Added this to the &#34;Purple&#34; stuff when I serviced the rear differential on my Ford F150.  Read about it on the forums.
negative,One negative was shipping method of a heavy item in a shipping bag and contents were scattered about.  This is a edited review from a 5 star down to a 3 star rating due to the performance and ability to tighten properly after using it for a couple of months to tow a small camper.  I have a 1.25 hitch and have tightened the bolts as tight as they will go and still have undesirable movement.
positive,Got the steps and meet our needs. Good traction and nicely made
positive,A little pricey for a piece of stainless but it is high quality and well made.
positive,"This did the trick exactly for my Ford 3230 and I imagine for all &#34;standard&#34; tractors. The color is right, the manufacturing quality is good, and you know it right away when you feel the heavy box on your desktop. If you haven't ever swapped out a seat, the job takes minutes with the right wrenches."
positive,Value for money!
positive,"I’m so very pleased with these lights, These are on my 91 Goldwing 1500I with the brakes applied, what a huge difference, Wish I could add more pictures but it won’t let me, there’s no way your not gonna see me on the road in front of you, Awesome!!!"
positive,"These CKAuto wheel spacers worked perfectly! They fit my 2020 FJ Cruiser. When I was driving my FJ Cruiser off-road, they hold up very well and I didn't have any issues. They have great quality and no vibration. It is such a great product and I will recommend it to my friends!<br />Here are some tips: Make sure to clean the surface of the bearing for good contact between the spacers and the hub. Remember to get some good anti-seize and slather it on there in case that you ever want to remove the spacers. You better to have a torque wrench, to make sure them to get the proper spec."
negative,This Battery does not hold a charge. Has minimal cold cranking power and if let outside or in your shed with temperatures under 35 it will die. You get what you pay for and with this thats not much
positive,Great product. Used over windows on my camper. Noice!
positive,Bought one version from the local place and it didn’t seal properly but this one did the trick for my 99 Honda CR-V.
positive,So far it has done as advertised.
positive,Worked perfectly and installation was a breeze (2-bolts)!  I just hope the long-term quality is as good as the original OEM.
positive,Easy to program
positive,Worked great for me and I no longer have vapor lock issues on my fuel line. AAA+++
positive,Well I held off to write a review until I've put these to the test. I did have a problem with one side leaking from where I inserted the elbow for the airline. I most likely over tightened honestly. But I emailed customer service and explained what my problem was and they immediately sent me a replacement airbag the next day. Much appreciated and the airbags work great now and hold pressure like they should. Very easy to install
positive,Easy to install and keeps the rain off my windows.
positive,Needed this part for my 2003 Honda CRV. Glad we can find it on Amazon if it fits perfectly.
positive,Nice fit for my Nissian and good price
negative,Other than the fact that i had no idea where most of these peices went they worked well and seem to be holding ok
positive,I changed this on my 2004 Elantra at 100k miles because it was time :).  It was an easy job to do myself (just search online for instructions) and saved me alot of money off of mechanic pricing.  Only tool you really need is a screwdriver.  This filter has worked well and it got my Check Engine Light to go off as the old one had too much buildup.  I would recommend this to anybody and tell them that with patience they can do it themselves with minimal mechanical ability.  Just be careful you will get gasoline all over your car!
positive,"Perfect, Just as described... Would most defiantly purchase again, Great Product!<br />DKH<br />Oklahoma City, OK 73170"
positive,"I’ve only had this a couple of weeks so I can’t speak to the durability. It feels well built and fits well. I was deciding between this and one by weathertec. No question, Weathertec makes great products, but for $50 more, I couldn’t justify buying it over the rugged ridge. At a certain level, protection is protection, and I have no apprehension of the rugged ridge protecting my cargo area. The side walls are high all the way around and it feels like it should hold up to whatever I throw at it. Looks nice as well!"
positive,still working since install
positive,"I wanted to ensure I gave this time to allow an honest review. After a few weeks and a handful of washes I can confirm this thing is legit. Looks amazing, fits like a glove, half the price of OEM, I would even say better than the one Ford sells. Overall I am happy and would definitely recommend."
positive,"This thing is amazing! My husband makes fun of me for basically carrying around a “duffle bag” sized purse...and when I have a passenger in my car, I never have space to put my purse without it accidentally dumping out or in a place I can’t reach while driving (in case I need to pull out my wallet or whatnot). This thing has changed my life! Lol! It holds my purse so that it’s out of the way but still conveniently placed within reach in case I need to get into it. The little pocket on the mesh is also perfect because it’s where I store my umbrella and tissues. I love this thing and can’t recommend it enough. I was scared it would get in the way every time I needed to open my center console storage compartment but it really doesn’t."
positive,"Works well, but I find that I need to reapply often (every other ride) to my bike chain to keep it smooth. It works better in the summer, since rain seems to wash it off easily and it doesn't work as well if dirt or anything else sticks to it. Still, I like it when its nice and dry out, and the chain definitely s***s smoothly with it, even smoother than with chain oil."
positive,"KapscoMoto has been terrific.  The first shipment arrived as an empty priority mail envelope with 3.5&#34; slit in the side. So I emailed KapscoMoto and they sent a replacement right away.  And by the way, the link break tool is great too."
negative,they have a base and are not low profile to the glass mirror .. stick out pas the mirror borders ... rain and snow get behind the glass.
positive,Easy to install covers the seat well  keeps dogs wet snowy paws<br />Off the light color seats
positive,Worked as needed! Great price!
positive,"professionally done product, looks and feels quality."
positive,works great
positive,"Hey, need I say more?"
positive,Heavy duty & sturdy. Hooked to camper bumper to haul bike rack.
positive,Works perfectly just make sure to connect to led light tightly.
positive,fit my 2013 altima
positive,Works as described in.
positive,I always seem to end up getting a fram filter instead of any other brand.  They are priced right and work great.
positive,Easy to install. Quick delivery.
positive,"First, due to the low price and free shipping, I was able to order new support lifts for the rear hatch AND the front hood for about the same price that I was going to pay at a local parts store for just the rear hatch support lifts! Four for the price of two - hard to beat that!<br /><br />Like the first reviewer, I also installed these on the rear hatch of my 1995 Camaro Z28.  They're pretty easy to install (the only tool I used was a small straight slot screw driver) and they work great.  In fact, they almost work too well, if there is such a thing.  But now the rear hatch comes flying up at a pretty rapid pace and I use one hand to slow it down to a controlled speed.  And this is one heavy hatch!  When the old lifts bit the dust, it would take both hands to raise the hatch, then hold it up with one hand while rooting around with the free hand.  So for these support lifts to raise that heavy hatch is saying something about their strength.  Definitely a good product and highly recommended, especially at the low price & free shipping available here on Amazon.<br /><br />Installation tip: I used a 2x4 (with a towel wrapped around each end to protect the interior of the car) to firmly/safely hold up the hatch while I installed these support lifts.  You definitely don't want the hatch to fall unexpectedly and break the rear glass or smash body parts!"
positive,Wife loves it.  It does look like a giant bubble gum bubble LOL
positive,Bought this and it worked perfectly. Was easy to put together.
positive,perfect for a sienfeld fan
positive,"The Sidewinder Sewer Hose Support arrived in excellent condition and on time.  I've examined the support, and it looks easy to use, but I have not as yet had an opportunity to use it."
positive,Easy to install and works good. 2004 chev duramax extended cab
positive,Every car & truck shouldn't leave home without one.
positive,"Item received quickly and as described, worked perfectly!"
positive,"Easy and worthwhile upgrade, one of the lower priced Kuryakyn pieces too.  The stock pedal cover is only held on with adhesive to the frame blade of the pedal.  Rip it off, put adhesive on the frame blade and screw together the front and back of this cover over it."
positive,Just as designed.
positive,"We use this lock for a large bike rack that we use on the back of Ford F-250; works well, easy to use."
negative,"I was very disappointed in the pouch and tried to return it, but I had to pay the shipping. It cost more to return it than I paid for the pouch, so it is stuck in a drawer. My purse would not fit in the pouch and the strings to hold it in place are just that....strings. Save your money for the next model."
positive,Wife loved it
positive,"Four month old baby protected from the hot Florida sun with these.  Bought them for the caregiver but like them so much I might just get them for my car even though the windows are already tinted.  I wasn't sure about the whole 'over the door' concept, but Amazon returns being what they are, I took the risk.  Glad I did.  5 stars for a reason.  I'm a fan of the quality, the design, the whole deal.  Great product.<br />(Haven't noticed the the blind spot mentioned in other posts.  Will update if opinion changes)"
positive,Fit perfectly and replaced the rusted factory mount with out a problem.
positive,"APPLICATION: AUTOMOTIVE AUXILIARY LIGHTING SWITCH<br /><br />I got tired of LED-lit toggle switches as they require extra wiring and are usually of poor quality, so I gave a try on this.  I would say this switch is the best I've tried so far (have not tried switches that are sold only in Japan).  The toggle action has a positive feel to it, the distinctive shape lets me know the difference from other switches without looking.  The rubber boot at the base is a nice touch (different colours would even be nicer, but blue seems the only choice at the moment), and it comes in a static-sensitive package, although it is an electrical device, not an electronic device that can be damaged by the discharge from your finger, etc...<br /><br />The country of origin is unknown, but judging from the kanji-wiring they are probably made in Taiwan.  I bought the 2nd switch and might consider getting the 3rd one as there is no competitor at the moment."
positive,"This quadcopter is a nice, light outdoor flyer for the backyard. I use it to take cinematic videos chasing my dogs around the property. All in all it's a nice whoop if you want something quick and small for a few minutes of downtime"
positive,"Works great, a little hard to undo when you have on winter gloves but overall a great product."
positive,"Just about every size you'll ever need for o-ring needs.  Good product, great price."
positive,When set up correctly with 93 unleaded pump gas raises octane to approx 116 RON
positive,"Good motor oil, good package. Easy pours without spillage, and has two handles for ease of use. Full synthetic so I would think you'd easily get 10,000 miles in between oil changes."
positive,My boyfriend loved this as a gift and it works well - just a little flimsier than I would hope. Good for the price.
positive,"Assembly was pretty simple. I do wonder about the Clevis pins in a critical spot, vs a bolt or something else.<br /><br />However, it's very strong. The joint from the Hitch piece to the back piece is held together by a Clevis pin, and the joint doesn't sit 100% touching (meaning I imagine this is where some strain might be able to crack the section. Time will tell if it lasts, but seems like it would (at least everything but the middle of the 'receiver tube 1 and 2' in the parts list)<br /><br />Also, a little wiggle in the hitch as stated, but once a load is on it, it's a non issue. I can't imagine many people drive around with this empty (unhitch it and throw it in the pickup bed)."
positive,I had another one that was falling apart so I ordered this one. It has enough room to hold a lot and sits high on the seat. My only issue is the strap around the head piece could be longer. I used to just slip it on and off the head piece making it very easy when my hands were full but now I have to no snap it which then makes it fall and if I'm not using both hands to hold it when it's about to fall everything dumps out. Bring back the longer strap.
positive,Fit perfectly and has stuck great
positive,"I might have given this 5 stars, but when they cut it from the big roll it wasn't cut straight.  Also, I wish it was just a little wider, as I have to be very exact when I drive into the garage to be centered.  It was quite heavy, but I was able to drag it from the porch to the garage without too much trouble (I'm a female in my 60's).  Very tightly wrapped, but once I got past the layers of that, it just rolled right out.  One of the ends wasn't flat that first day, but by day two it was flat as a pancake.  Will have to see how it does this winter when I have slush falling off the car, but so far I like it and several of my neighbors have asked me about it.  I ordered the slate gray and was worried it might be too blue based upon the picture, but it's really just a dark gray."
negative,Definitely don't like it
positive,They fit nice as the original.
positive,good product would buy again.company has great service
positive,Great Job!
positive,Great looking item for your auto that needs some being added to it
positive,"Great for my GM vehicles.  Put the car into learn mode from the dash, walk around and press button at each corner. Order is important: front driver, front passenger, rear passenger, rear driver. Worked A++."
negative,If it was not for the fact that every single part of fake plastic fell from the cup holder it would be great.
positive,Works very well on my Hyundai so far.  May upgrade to 5 stars if it lasts long enough.
positive,I like everything about it but the price.  I should have shopped around for other suppliers.
positive,"2 things were excellent. 1) customer service 2) The product. When it shipped, the cap was cracked and a bit of the product made the box messy. I asked for a new cap. They were FANTASTIC! I was sent a reply apologizing and offered some interior detail spray as a gift as well as the replacement cap. Well, I got both and then tried both products and they are excellent. The suds were plenty, my car cleaned nicely and the detail really did the job on the inside, too! I’m a fan!"
positive,"Actually bought this for a small car and although its a little big, it makes it easy to put on and take off.  I like it"
positive,Correct fit
positive,Love the Bink!
positive,love it great product thanks
positive,Great product. It keeps everything where it’s supposed to be and easily accessible.
positive,Go for it
negative,I cant believe I paid six bucks for this.....a fool and his money
positive,We have a pleasure farm and our diesel tractor sometimes hates the cold. This works great to jump it ....also our 4 wheeler and lawn mower. So easy to use. And long lasting charge. Great power will allow multiple jumps!
positive,Works like it is described
positive,I too had to buy this without a photo. It is a perfect 14x14 fantastic fan replacement shroud. Just the rectangle trim piece. It may be too tall for you so just take a side-angle grinder and cutoff wheel or dremel tool to cut it down to the thickness of your roof.<br />Great replacement if yours are cracked.
positive,Correct parts fit perfectly.
positive,"Fits great, replacement is not for the faint of heart. Way better price than local part store. Nice to have brakes again."
positive,D
positive,"We've been camping a lot lately to make up for all the camping we couldn't do when the pandemic was raging. Camping for four means our crossover has had to do double duty in both transporting us to the camp site and carrying all our tents and equipment. That means we carry a lot of it on the roof, and getting the roof rack set up is a trying exercise unto itself. That's where this little guy comes in.<br /><br />It works like this: every door has a latch inside that keeps the door closed. When the door is open, this latch is exposed. The door hook clicks over it, and then the rotating wheel adjusts to ensure it doesn't damage the paint as it unfolds. You now have a foot stool that can handle 440 lb. (but please, don't test it with that much weight!).<br /><br />I stood on this several times to load and unload our crossover on our last camping trip. It works great. The only problem is that it's just one stool, so it's a bit awkward (there's nowhere to put your other foot!), but that's not the fault of the tool."
positive,I have this hooked up to my trailers emergency breaking system and it has been sitting outside in my trailer for almost a year though a rather cold winter (-5 - 20 deg F) and last time i used my trailer it was still charged and working correctly.
positive,Great product. If you are cleaning fabric or carpets do yourself a huge favor and buy the 4&#34; round brush you can mount in the drill. Makes a good job look absolutely perfect!<br />A little of this product goes a long way
positive,Great
positive,I am using these as fishing rod holders.
negative,"For the price this is a good liner and perfectly fits my 2019 RDX. There's even a crease so it folds back like the original Acura liner if you need to get into your storage compartment. I researched comparable brands/prices and liked that this was foldable & didn't cover the left side compartment.<br /><br />Some flaws for me: not super heavy/thick, but does the job of protecting carpet (no issues with spills yet, so I'm hoping nothing soaks through). I really wanted a non slippery liner - and this seems SLIPPERY...Biggest con for me. Not really any traction here..and that was a huge reason why I wanted a liner in the first place. If you own an RDX you know the carpet is super soft and anything you have in your trunk slides everywhere!!  Haven't owned it long enough to see if this is a problem for me, but good to know since they advertise this as ""not slippery""...."
positive,husband said it was fine and was as stated.
negative,Junk. No instructions. Super cheap hardware. Template is piss poor. Not for tj but can MAKE it work.
positive,Razor sharp edges around frame otherwise excellent
positive,good
positive,"I’ll be honest these were not the easiest to install but I’m so glad I put in all the effort to put them on. These are great because they have lumbar support. I think they look really nice and would be nice upgrade to any car. I like that this product prevents wear and tear that can happen over time to the original car seat. One thing that I didn’t expect was for my seat warmers to not be so warm anymore, but I don’t think that should stray you away from this product."
positive,2002 Pontiac Montana fit perfect
positive,Nice riding she verses boots. Breathable and light weight.
positive,"Before I saw these, I was gonna make them with 2x6, Its a good thing i found these.<br />Lightweight, durable resin has a non-slip surface and it Has a built-in handle.<br />No need to stack a bunch of plywood , Just set them down front or back of the tire and drive up on to any of the three levels."
positive,Thinner than orginal fender but mechanic applied it with no problem.
positive,Screw off the old one and used this for hard to reach zerks on the control arms.
positive,Perfect part. Went right in with ease. The seller was extremely kind!
positive,This is a quality product.
negative,"2 days after putting these in the driver's side ripped then a couple days later the back of the passenger cover ripped. Never even put the back bench cover on because it wouldn't fit. Should have saved my money and bought better. You definitely get what you pay for with these cheap, thin  covers"
positive,Pretty darn herky and well made
positive,"i only put this in my 2001 BMW that I drive 1000 miles a week in.  BMW has over 200,000 miles on it and it is still running strong.  Love this oil!"
negative,"This product does NOT work.  In fact, it made the wind noise worse."
positive,"if you have a travel trailer or class B/C you will need these. More so if travel trailer.  Our in-laws borrowed ALL of ours at one campsite; they were lucky we didn't need them- they needed ALL of ours to level as their site was terribly uneven. Our site was perfect so we were able to let them use all of ours. We have like 30; long ones, short ones. And yes we have had to use all 30 at a site once, yikes, glad we had them. They level the tires, level out the plane for the Auto Level jacks and serve to help with step entry if the site is REALLY off kilter. been there done that, made steps out of them."
positive,This is perfect! I bought a used car and I couldn’t see the locked or unlocked buttons. This was a perfect fit for my 2012 Ford Escape and made it cute and easy to read.
negative,Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend to put in this car. Doesn't actually work unless the car is off. When the engine is on it says we're moving east at all times. Sad panda.
positive,"This review was written by my husband because well, I have no clue how to put shocks on a truck..lol And since I watched, there was no way, no how I could even begin to try to.<br /><br />Arrived earlier than expected which was great because it gave me the weekend to get them put on.<br />I have a 2014 F350 SRW long bed (12,000 miles) and my daily commute consists of driving several miles on a concrete highway with a ton of expansion joints. As many others have experienced, I was bouncing so much that I felt my bones would rattle themselves apart. I couldn't even drink my coffee on the way to work without spilling it everywhere. The stock Rancho shocks were pure garbage.<br /><br />I bought this set after seeing many people say it was a great improvement. To me, that is an understatement. It's like the difference between night and day with these on. Sure, it's not 100% smooth like a Cadillac, but there's such a huge improvement on the ride, it just makes me love my truck even more, not to mention I can now enjoy my coffee on the way to work. No more feeling like the bounce would make me wreck (yes, it was that bad).<br /><br />I highly recommend that anyone with a Ford F250/F350 that has that wicked bounce, buy these. I doubt you will be disappointed."
negative,"Other than the fact that the side marker light tabs were broken off. And I didn’t realize that they were until I was installing them, the lights look good. I didn’t expect much for $70. Ended up redneck rigging and used lots of zip ties and the help of my trophy truck fenders to keep them in place until I can buy new lights."
positive,"Bought a set of these for my 26' boat that's parked in my driveway. I was using blocks of wood but decided to try these as they are compact and easy to handle. They do have a very strong rubber smell when first opened but because they're used outdoors, don't pose an issue. When backing my trailer into the driveway the braking unit deactivates but the brake piston stays in. I chock both sides of the trailer and pull forward with my tow vehicle to pull the brake piston back out. These hold the trailer in position without slipping. I would recommend."
positive,"These are better than nothing! Work well, grip around tire good. The weather takes a beating on them after a year+, wish these would last longer, end up getting brittle. but like I said... bettere than nothing"
positive,Perfect fit!
positive,"Needed one of these batteries to replace the one for my house alarm.  Radio Shack's price was a lot more expensive.  Be sure you know what size your terminals are, because they might be a different size.  If so you just have to cut off the old ones and install new ones that match the terminal size of the battery."
positive,I really love the AVS wind reflectors.<br />Installed on my 2021 4 runner.<br /> Easy to install ( within minutes with excellent adhesion.  No hassle or frustration to install as “in channel” (and risk damaging vehicle with scratches or tearing weatherstrip).<br />The “low profile” is a stealthy aesthetic look as opposed to bubbley flared -out reflectors of the past.<br /> Highly recommend!
positive,Loved it! Looks awesome
positive,Easy to install. Even figured out how to get old fans to fit inside bulkhead. Saved some bucks and it does the job.
positive,These lifts seem to be more powerful than the OEMs but the fit is good.  The hatch seems to fly up way faster than it originally did but they are made well and work great.
positive,east instructions
positive,"I just put 500 miles on these pads and so far they've been great. Quiet and best of all far superior in stopping power compared to the stock pads on my 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander. Why Mitsu fitted the car with such inferior pads, I have no idea. These remedy the harder to stop feel the stock pads give off, the same feeling like the lines needs to be bled or you need braided lines.<br /><br />So far so good, time will tell on longevity.<br /><br />Aug 29th edit: there is a ton of brake dust with these pads, making my rims dark. Removed 1 star for this, otherwise so far so good"
positive,"Product as described, easy install"
negative,Didnt fit
positive,"Use mine for BMX racing.  Came early, well made,  sexy colors and design!!!  I may not be the fastest out there, but I look the best!!"
positive,Nice subtle bling
positive,"The right parts for installation, could not tell that the stereo had not been professionally installed.  Will definitely buy Metra kits again."
negative,Wish it could be screwed at the bottom too to tighten it more.  I hear it when I slam the hatch and if I hit a bump.  Sill proud to have it on the car!!
negative,Was the one that fit but my truck is a two prong this one only has one
negative,"Although the AmazonConfirmedFit indicated this product fit the 2008 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, it required a modification to the mounting bracket for fitment. Also, the thickness of this item is quite larger than the low profile OEM connector and protrudes about 2 inches above the bracket. Electrically, it seems to work fine but it is not a simple plug-n-play replacement for my vehicle as was advertised on the Amazon listing."
positive,Really great product. Makes cleaning easy!
positive,real not a counterfeit item
positive,"I've used these tires many times as replacements for bald tires I get  with bikes that need to be re-done. Great tires for the money and performance is more than acceptable. If you're not a racer, these are good all around tires."
positive,Fits perfectly for our 2009 Outback Keystone slide outs. Thick with wire weaving for strength.
positive,In todays world of different coolants you can't go wrong with the OEM stuff. The stuff that you can get at the auto parts store may say that its compatible but you never really know and if it turns to jelly in your coolant overflow tank you have bigger problems.
positive,Really feel strong and sturdy. Seems like they will lift whatever if you can turn the handle.
positive,It works
negative,"The tires are fine and the rims will suit their purpose. However, the rims look they there were spray painted with Zinc and then packed prior to letting them dry. The paint pooled at the bottom.<br />In the end, they function perfectly well but they look terrible."
positive,"Take care of your tires because without them your not going anywhere. It will restore your tires to factory. It's acid free with no dyes or scents. It removes silicone,  grease, wax, polymers. Spray straight from the bottle. But can be diluted if you want to extend it use. Easy to use and worth using to keep your car it's best"
positive,"I've done hundreds of rotors and can only say I always enjoy when customers go with quietcast rotors. I ended up putting theses on my 99 Lexus ES300 mainly because I have yet to have a comeback or complaint from them when paired with the matching quietcast pads. I can't tell you how many times I've had wearever ,wagner or brakebest stuff either come in wrong sized, mislabeled, defective, damaged, or comeback with noise complaints that I just end up getting fed up with it. An now with ebay chinese no name rotors I'm seeing more and more of, it just makes me want to recommend these even more. You usually can save 10-15$ buy going with amazon over o'reillys but if it's your only car and your brakes are completely shot I would probably say buy local just in case or make sure they have them in stock as a backup. Overall I recommend"
positive,Great product and nice quality. Taken two trips now using them and very happy
positive,Does an outstanding job on keeping the sun out and the dash protected. Made really well and easy to unfold and put into place.
positive,i always adore hello kitty. this one matches my hello kitty theme car. this steering wheel wont slip in your hand. very cute!
negative,"Wrong item, Specs list my truck but it did not fit. Compare your current Refrigerant Line's bends and lengths to make sure they match the one pictured. The picture is accurate to the one shipped but it did not match the one in my truck I was replacing. Comes in a BIG box. Product looked good and should work if it fits your vehicle."
positive,"Great product. Use it in all of my lawn tractors, lawn mowers, chainsaws and weed eaters to keep the fuel fresh during inactive and active months; always add Stabil.<br /><br />Not fun or inexpensive to rebuild/replace carburetors. Big money/time saver to add stabilizer to fuel even if you're going to burn it up. Have noticed that in some small engines adding Stabil and leaving it sit over the winter, the engine runs even better. NO issues starting up. That is just great and a pleasant surprise. At least it was with one of my lawn tractors, an MTD. I actually ordered a new carb for the MTD expecting to replace it this spring but the Stabil seemed to of cleaned out whatever was causing the idle issue.<br /><br />Have bought from the seller twice already and am very happy with the product and shipping which has been within 2-3 days. Highly recommend. Also recommend waiting for and watching the price, you can save up to 50% compared to buying from local big box stores.<br /><br />Highly recommend!"
positive,"This is a great device for maintaining your battery. I'm using it to maintain my mower battery. It's built well and operates effectively. Worth the money! I'm glad I didn't ""cheap out."""
positive,Works great!
positive,"Great 90-degree coupler for a grease gun.  Exactly what I needed to get to some fittings in a tight area.  Like the Lumax LX-1400-2 standard coupler, this one does not simply pull off.  To remove it from a fitting, I've had to twist while pulling, I've never had trouble with it not pulling off a fitting as long as I twist while pulling."
negative,"Junk, its too small for anything heavy and the material its made from is soft so it's trash.<br /><br />  We should never need to buy anything like this when buying Curt attachments for Curt hitches. The fact we must use anything like this just to stop load rattling only means one thing and that is Curt products are no longer made with tight enough specs. Not even to mate up with their own products,now how sad is that quality control have to be?<br /> If Curt products are so poorly designed they don't fit together tight without extra parts it's time to just buy attachments made from other companies instead.<br />  Curt already knows their products don't fit together right or they would never made this part. Easier to make this than fixing their problems associated with it is my guess."
negative,It ripped as I was putting it on my spare tire.
positive,"The bayonet fitting hoses work with no twisting and no leakage.<br />Simply the best, we aren’t ever going back to the old way."
positive,"very nice fit, texture, and well made."
positive,"Tested these and they're definitely stainless steel (and look it, more nickel than the bright silver of zinc plated steel) and seem good quality, especially for the price. Just make sure you order the right ID for the OD of your hose."
positive,"Great price,fits great,love the visors. Ratchet chinstrap. This helmet is great."
negative,The bed mat was too short for my 2001 Ford F-150.
positive,"It's not bad, it plugged right in and my phone connected in less then 2-3 minutes. Now only if I could get my phone to stay connected to it for more then 15 seconds with out jumping to the next wireless signal that passes by, I might be able to actually use this thing. When it was connected, it was giving me the information I was needing. So it works!?"
positive,Got this for my 12 bolt type O rearend. Installed just fine.
positive,"I can't say because I've been sick since it came in, but at the same time, it looks like the one that came with the truck. But once I can I'd be happy to you know."
positive,I needed low amp fuses for an access control system.  This had them - cost was less than I would pay for a few fuses!  It even came with some fuse holders - sweet!  I'll use them in my car.
positive,Works great and easy to do! Big savings!
positive,Top quality and price. Would buy again.
positive,Would buy again
positive,item as described
positive,works great..used to all my aquaponics tank
positive,Good for top down situations where protection from direct sun is desired.
positive,"Very simple basic continuity tester.  I like it, it does the job I ordered it for.  Would buy again"
positive,"This cleaner will restore the shine on chrome and remove surface rust. However, it seems a bit abrasive and the maker says it's for ""light use,"" so I would use it only on chrome that has some rust spots and not anything I really cared about."
positive,It fits my 2007 Tundra great. I have no issue it them.
positive,Fit my 2004 Grand am perfect
positive,Good
positive,really like it
positive,It worked great
positive,Great white graphics....&#34;come take my gun&#34;...plastered on both side of my Escalade (I am a woman) where everyone can see!
positive,This was not nearly as difficult to install as some reviews implied.  Didn't need a hair dryers or any other heating device to get it to stretch onto the steering wheel.  I did have to use more than a little muscle.  I am glad I bought iit.  I like it a lot!
positive,just what I needed.
positive,"Air fresheners are a gimmick always too strong at first and quickly fade. This stuff smells clean, not too strong, and lasts a long time. I kid you not, I even used this on a smoker's car before. I replaced the cabin air filters, vacuumed and wiped everything down, and then followed the instructions for this and the smell was completely gone! It's amazing. And for $5 as an add on product, you seriously cannot go wrong!"
positive,Easy install and looks great!
positive,Excellent user manual. Worth every cent
positive,"I have been using KYB products since the late '70s. I have never had any complaint. In fact, all their suspension products work wonderfully! These shocks are no exception. I installed them on a 2002 Ford Ranger 4WD. I wanted to tow a two horse trailer. My Hellig booster springs simply overpowered the old Ford shocks. Not these, they work great! The trailer and truck now feel totally stable."
positive,Thank you works great!
negative,"I used this on my tires and exterior trims (black plastic) and the result was pretty good. Nice subtle shine on them but after the first rainy day, severe water marks developed on the plastic trims, looking ugly (and in fact uglier than pre-treatment). The tires still look good though. I do not use this product on the black plastic trims anymore."
positive,"Wasn't sure if my son needed a new cable, or new clutch plates. Bought a new cable and it fixed the clutch issues perfectly. Old one must have been stretched out. This one is good quality and fits very well."
positive,"Having purchased a different version of one of these nets, I knew what I wanted differently this time around.  The key to these holders is the deep front pocket.  The other one I purchased was a waste because it was so short.  The deep pocket works as a stabilizer for the back pocket.  This particular holder also has non-elastic straps so it does not stretch out - which is an issue if you have passengers who need to move their seat back and forth."
positive,Good oil. Car runs smoothly.
positive,I like that the reverse lights are really bright.
positive,"lots of space, very easy to install on the bike, sturdy and solid. I am very satisfied with this purchase."
positive,But it is just the right size for a lawn mower.
positive,"Love them, really bright and awesome look. Great value."
positive,Great  gift for my daughter to keep in her car for trips
negative,It slides around a lot and its just a tad too small but it looks amazing and i get compliments all the time
positive,"Husband loved this,  looks nice on his truck window!"
positive,Excelente precio y muy recomendable
positive,Love it
positive,There is only one aspect of this product that keeps it from being perfect in every way: the colors don't change with each thump in the beat. It is programmed to do nearly everything else and I couldn't ask for better quality from the components for the price (all other products on amazon considered). I am buying more as my truck is large and I want the whole cab to be flooded with light. I can buy more splitters and strips separately and add on to this system.
positive,Thank you
negative,It looked nice but after installing in 3 times it didn't work.
positive,It fit perfectly. Came with extra lubricant. Took truck on test drive and it brakes.well with a good feel in the pedal. Looking forward to great braking in the future.
positive,Excellent quality! Only wish I would have purchased these sooner. Far exceeded my expectations.
positive,bright light with super magnet.  great to keep in the car for night time emergencies.  stands on its own.  cordless nad rechargeable
negative,Super flimsy stuff. Made out of soft rubber and comes in a roll. You’d be better off getting the hard ones from the parts store.
positive,good drop for hauling small camper.
negative,If you're getting these as a replacement for your factory pieces they will fit good as long as you use the original support. The support provided does not fit -period. I'm a professional auto technician with all the tools available to make something work and I was not able to attach the bases (supports). I ended up using the old (metal) support instead of the provided (plastic) ones and I got a very good fit on the outside covers.
positive,"perfect OEM replacement. less than 5 minutes to replace. My kids broke the original, glad this was available so cheap."
positive,The easiest food thermometer I've used.
positive,perfect
negative,"I have had a few different GPS devices but this is by far the worst.  I bought this because my old Garmin wasn't getting satellite signals any more.  I listened to other poeple telling me how great thier TomTom's were.  Well, I made the mistake of buying this.  Right from the very start the divice took 20 to 30 minutes to get a signal.  I thought it would get better.  Well it didn't.  I could be where I was supposed to be sometimes before this thing got a signal.  Another thing is the sound is very low.  You can't have a conversation in the car and listen to this at the same time.  I only used this thing about 15 times and when I really needed it because I really had no idea where I was -  it just died.  The screen went black and it never came back on.  I have had this device about 1 year (bought it last May) and I am throwing it in the garbage where it belongs.  I am back to using reliable Garmin."
positive,Good
positive,"My crew of landscapers needed a simple solution for getting wheelbarrows over the occasional step when we are trying to apply mulch to a landscape, yet we didn't need one of the bigger aluminum ramps, just something small and simple that we could customize as needed for different jobs.<br /><br />This worked a charm! In about 15 minutes we had turned a couple of simple boards into a set of two ramps that we can guide the wheelbarrow down. What I appreciate is that if were not going to be using it for a few months, you just take a minute at the end of the job to unscrew the boards and then the storage is even easier.<br /><br />This is a great product and an absolutely recommend it for anybody who needs to load occasional things into a truck or occasionally get wheelbarrows down a couple of garden steps."
positive,"Very good article, very good deal nice, very good price, item arrived on time, the packaging had an acceptable size"
positive,Excelente producto y servicio
negative,"I ordered this for my 2015 Jeep patriot, and it did not fit at all. I had to cut it way down and even then it didn't match the shape of the trunk."
positive,"Had to cut down to door size, no problem.  Really makes opening and closing the travel trailer door easier and less stress on the little door handle."
positive,Exactly what was needed. No issues
positive,I bought this for my 2004 SAAB 9-3 after the passenger side headlight burned out. It can be easily installed and seems brighter than my original light bulb.
positive,good sponges for good price.
positive,Went on easy looks great.
positive,Great
positive,Been using it for months in my work vehicle. Not large enough for bigger trash but works just fine.
positive,I had a pro install a mat wrap on the console when wrapping the front end of the car. Looks great but eventually gets scratched. I put this on top of the wrap. Looks really nice. Really good deal and anyone AP can install.
positive,Ford 2017 outback perfect! Comes with alcohol pads for cleaning the area.
positive,Husband loved shirt fit was perfect
positive,"These nice wide hooks work very nicely.  I have used the thinner, wire hooks in my car and they are a pain as plastic bag handles get between them and make them hard to extract.  These wide hooks are the best!"
negative,"Purchased for 2004 Toyota Corolla center console cigarette lighter upgrade. The diameter of the faceplate is much too large to fit in the stock placement. Not dremeling as it would leave a horrible gouge mark.<br /><br />With a little elbow grease, works on a motorcycle circuit and will be installing on a ninja 300. Will also install with a switch to disable for rainy weather."
negative,"smells good, but you need to be super close to smell it"
positive,Ordered for my husband when he was camping last year.  He didn't complain so I guess it worked great.
negative,There is nothing at all special about this spray wax to result in the price they are asking. It's hard to apply and streaky. There is no gloss whatsoever. I got 10 times better results using Lucas speed wax
positive,Great product at a good price
positive,"I purchased the same item for my 2012 Camry in 2012; after 7+ years and multiple washes (mostly in drive-thru, brushes, flappers, etc.), they still look like original equipment"
negative,It was delivered dead and had to be recharged in order for it to be used - but it worked
positive,"Bought two of these, have a two car garage. My garage floor was spalling from years of melting snow, salt, etc. You really need a buddy to help as the material is heavy, but I did manage to do the installation myself. This product looks fantastic on the floor and makes the garage look so much nicer. I have a work area in front of my cars and its so nice having this product on the floor. Highly recommend."
positive,Seems like good quality. Happy with purchase.
negative,The controller cable did not fit my 2017 Tacoma. White connectors were completely different on my track and the control.<br /><br />Minor points.<br />> Poor directions. Diagram showed 4 8X32 screws for mounting bracket. I only received two.<br />> No direction on what to do with white wire with ring terminal.<br />> cable too short for mounting on right side of steering column.
positive,still in use n working
positive,"Had a little trouble placing it on, but once it was on, it made the wheel look nice. It blends well with the interior design of my car and keeps my steering wheel cool so I won’t burn my hands while driving around."
negative,"These filters are 1/8 inch thicker than the OEM filters in my car (model 3)! Couldn't get the first filter all the way in. It was too thick, (1/8 inch) it got stuck and it took me 2 hours to destroy it to get it out, because it WAS STUCK and it would not go down all the way so that I could put the 2nd one in on top. DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU ARE A FOOL! I bought a knock off afterwards of the OEM same day from Amazon (because I destroyed the one, it was unusable) and it was amazingly 1/16 smaller than the original cheap OEM that was already in my car from the factory, and it went right in and almost fell in. Perfect. What a stupid nightmare these stupid more expensive filters were, a one hour job turned into 5 hours, because I had to destroy the black charcoal style filter that was stuck, and then wait for the other filter to come from Amazon the next day. My car was laid up for 24 hours, at least!"
positive,"Can't write a longevity review yet, but if anything like other bulbs bought and installed, will be just fine...."
positive,"Since I cannot find my normal oil (Mobil 5K) anymore in the local wally world or auto stores, I choose this to put into my Lexus GX 470.  It also has received great reviews from a trusted mechanics on the ""tube.""  I've always perform my own maintenance and the label reflects this is a very good oil meant to be used in my vehicle.  This is good stuff and Highly recommend oil."
positive,"And I love it!!  I ordered a large, seems pretty accurate in size ( I am a 36/38 DD).  The vest is soft and leather is pliable, not super thick leather but not to thin either. I have gotten a lot of compliments on it the couple times I've worn it, including from men.........It zips almost &#34;corset-ish&#34;  looking.  The shipping was quick, happy I ordered it."
positive,"Easy install , looks good"
positive,Its easy to use. You have the accuracy of a digital meter but you must crank the engine in order to load test. Per instruction sheet you should disable the run wire to prevent starting the motor when cranking during a load test. I would PREFER the old style analog tester for load testing. I would still buy this again and recommend it to others for its ease of use and digital display.
positive,This tool makes it so much easier to remove a battery from a vehicle.
positive,Nice product for the price.  They aren't chrome but they weren't advertised as chrome.  They are a solid aluminum that hold up well.
positive,"Definitely not super durable, has lots of plastic parts but for the price - you can’t beat it!"
positive,Fit perfect
negative,Way too small to cover the rear of or 2015 Expedition. Flimsy and cheaply made.
positive,Perfect
negative,The 2 pictures of a tag in black are from this vendor.  Ordered another one from a different Amazon vendor.<br /> It is in red.  Notice the larger letters. Letters only 2 1/4” high from this vendor.  Could easily have been 3 1/4” high or more.  Too small to be good and visible.  Bought them to be visible.  Very disappointed.
positive,Nice quality
negative,"Size is slightly different than the plastic mounting frame that's on the car so it doesn't completely cover it. Will leave on my car, and look for a different one for my wife's car."
negative,I expected more of a scent..
positive,I bought these because I work in a dusty environment. They definitely keep the dust out of your eyes as well as looking awesome.
negative,"My 19yr old & I both thought the stickers looks like they were poorly printed off a low rare printer. But my 11yr old, who we bought them for, loved them. So that’s what counts"
positive,does not fit at all the back... no way to fasten cover with straps as back seats do not have access to the back and underneath to thread them...
positive,"Brighter than I expected.  No flickering, so far so good."
positive,"These were used as replacement ""Back-up"" light bulbs in both of our vehicles, which normally fit a 921 bulb.<br />They are perfect, direct replacement items for the 921 mini bulb, and are much, much brighter and whiter than those they replaced.<br />Better visibility when backing are the result!"
positive,Have not used this.  However the maintenance person for the motor home said it was a must have.
positive,Exactly what we needed. Bought one for the camper and one for the boat. Matching keys make the wife happy.
positive,"Only used it once so far but it did the job. Quick setup and take down. Living in Chicago, I am certain I will need this at least a few more times. Great deal."
positive,Exactly what I needed
positive,"Well that was the first thing that I saw, when the box came. However unit was packaged well, pre packed with pac oil, installed and running smooth and quite! It was new not re-man, and for the price, there's no way to beat it!"
positive,"Nice item, good finish. It would be nice if it was 3/8 inch longer in one direction to fit my states sticker, but that's not the fault of the maker. My state seems to think a sticker needs to be visible at 60, which no matter what size or where it was on a motorcycle. It's bigger than the stickers for the cars. I just wrapped the sticker over the edge and then razor knifed the sticker along the edge to prevent peeling. Better than having a sticker attached to the front forks which needs a razor scraper to remove."
negative,"I wore them on the bike twice. They did their job, were comfortable enough. I liked them. But they are very cheaply made, they fell on the ground when I went to put them on before a ride and the part where the elastic connects to the plastic frame broke. I super glued them back together, other wise I would have had to just chuck them. I haven't had a chance to use them since I super glued them, but I have no great expectations for them to last very much longer. Wish I had spent a bit more and gotten better quality. You live and you learn."
positive,I bought a 2004 VW Jetta for my son and when I had the new tires put on it the original locks were broken to put them on. The price was just right and very convenient. I shipped them off to him and he easily put them on with no problems.
positive,arrived on time and did what it was expected to do ~ Thanks!
positive,Works as described
positive,"Have used before, good value & good fit. Easy to install (04 Prius)."
positive,"Most truck and car frames are pre-drilled for bumpers and options from the factory, these can fit into those holes In the Frame of your truck."
positive,"Very good, I recommend it to everyone!"
positive,Great price and good quality.
positive,"With a little patience and taking time to layout/position the decal, this is easy to install and results look great.  Comes with installation instructions for the uninitiated.  A little pricey, I think, but if it holds up to TX heat and direct sun, it'll be worth it."
positive,Bought to replace the rusted and corroded brake line on my truck. Perfect fit.
positive,"Don't think of this as a five star rating, think of it as a yes or no rating, where five stars is &#34;yes&#34; and one star is &#34;no.&#34;<br /><br />Is it what I needed? Yes<br />Is it what I expected? Yes<br />It is working as it should? Yes<br /><br />It works well and if I need another I will purchase again"
positive,It works great! Does what it says. Everything downloaded and operated first try. Our vehicle was having trouble starting but knew it wasn't starter and FIXD told us the exact # of which cylinder wasn't firing & a few other minor things we needed to take care of before they became big issues.<br />Great tool to have!
positive,Works perfect. I found out that the Maf was not the problem. Throttle body wire was damaged. Regardless it's good to have an extra. I tried it on my Sentra Specv and Altima.
positive,"I would suggest the two-row radiator over this three row if you are using a 98 civic EX coupe.  It did not quite fit as “drop in”, however, after some creative pipe bending I got it in and my temp rarely goes over 190 on a pure NAS build."
positive,Good
positive,Perfect....fits great.
positive,WORKS LIKE IT SHOULD.  EASY TO INSTALL. SUPER COST EFFECTIVE
positive,First couple of days the end will twist completly off. I would have to re tighten it. It works. I love it. Not so hard in your pocket.
positive,"Amazing tire, exactly what I was looking for, the perfect amount of badness for my Dodge Nitro, About the performance, it's excellent, in accel and braking, the noise, I have not noticed any change traveling at speeds about 70 miles per hour. Perhaps they are not the cheaper but they worth it, money well spent."
negative,First off not even purple shown in the picture and only half a can not worth the money at all I won’t be able to do one caliper with this garbage I’m not happy at all
positive,It wipes
negative,This does NOT fit 2010 550i like it says it does.
negative,Might work for some people but couldn’t get it to pull out a small dent in my door. Maybe it’s too close to edge. Not sure
positive,i found the cups to be thicker than the otc brand and it is a pretty strong tool for being under 80 bucks. if i have it over a year and i bust it. oh well. ill buy another. under a year astro will be getting phonecalls untill they replace it..<br /><br />In some reviews some people complained about the tool being covered in oil... IT keeps it from rusting. clean it off  move on with your day... the BOLT if it has some messed up threads... Fix it!!! get a thread chaser and fix it.. odds are if you are using this tool you will have a thread chaser or will need one to fix stuff on your car.
positive,PERFECT.
positive,"Fit very well, easy to install"
positive,Excellent fit for 2001 4Runner rear shocks with 1989 4Runner springs
positive,I am pleased with the car wash. It leaves the car with a nice shine. Amazon had it on sale for a great price.
positive,"I'm giving this product 4 stars because it hasn't been installed very long and I can't confirm any claims around lifespan, lack of brake noise after extended use, etc. Aside from that unknown, the quality and fit seems 5 star worthy.<br /><br />The brakes and rotors replaced my factory equipment on a 2003 Jeep Wrangler. The brakes work really well. I recall a reviewer stating that you don't really notice the difference and performance capability under normal driving conditions, but the wow factor surfaces when you need to stop in a hurry. I concur, these work much better than stock brakes in that regard.<br /><br />I installed these myself in less than two hours after watching some online instructional videos. I have tools and a mechanical background but as a software consultant I don't routinely do this type of thing. If you're anxious about installing these yourself just follow the included instructions and online video instructions, advice, and recommendations and you'll be fine."
positive,Perfect replacement and best price online. Visors arrived as promised. Excellent supplier.
positive,For 2011 Seirra perfect and get compliments all the time on them. No issues.
positive,Identical fit to the original.
positive,Very pleasant scent. Not at all overpowering or too fru-fru for the guys. Easy to apply.
positive,Took 1 minute to install and fit perfect
positive,This stuff works great.
positive,"I did not buy this product through amazon but did buy the redline v twin transmission oil, yet after checking with the HD people they said to use the 42904 v twin primary oil to replace the oil in my lower end on my 2006 1200 sportster. So I used the Vtwin transmission oil to flush out any old oil residue out and then put the primary oil in it which I got from my local HD dealer.. I dont know what I really expected as my bike always shifted well, but my lower end had always been really noisy which HD said was normal for sportsters. It drove me  nuts as I came from a honda Kawasaki background  where you didnt hear such things, so I must say when testing my bike afterwards I was quite surprised when all the noise disappeared, or as much as my ears can detect. I will update with any changes but I highly recommend this product for a 2006 sportster.<br /><br />update. went out for a ride and put on 300 miles in 90 degree weather and my bike is quieter now than when I first bought it. Shifts smoother than it had, which was rather smooth to begin with. Im rather upset at myself for waiting this long to go with redline. No telling what internal wear I may have avoided if I had been using redline for the last 10 years. So yes, so far I highly recommend this product."
positive,Ok
positive,Have these on 2011 Mazdaspeed 3 for about 1 year.  So far so good.  For off brand all season tires they are surprisingly sticky.  I'm able to hit turns and maintain speeds without tire squeal.  I've driven windy roads in the mountains of the Bay Area with no issues.  The only downside is these tires are DIRECTIONAL!!!  It's not the end of the world but it sucks.  At $60 a piece def worth the buy.  I had Firehawk Indy 500 before which are fantastic summer tires but did not want to cash out for those.
positive,Cute in memory of our old boy
positive,works just as expected
positive,"perfect fit for our 03 tacoma. but as others have said, it doesnt come in a box but rather a label attached to this heavy metal item. so yours might end up scratched by the time it arrives. nothing some paint wont fix."
negative,Terrible gadget.<br />Can't use it
positive,Great price
positive,"Good fit, good price, good durability."
positive,Fantastic fit for my 17 GMC Sierra
positive,"It works as advertised. Super-easy installation, 5 minutes tops."
positive,They took great care in the delivery to make sure it was not creased or bent. The flag is awesome. I took my time and it turned out fantastic. I would recommend this product to anyone.
positive,Battery cover does not like to stay on. Easy to read and us and seems to be accurate
positive,My kitchen is very small and I have almost no counter space. I had to arrange my dishes on a dish cloth to dry. This dish drainer fits exactly like I wanted! I wish I'd thought of one that's for use in an RV a long time ago.
positive,"This was one of the best finds I've made on Amazon.  After reading a lot of posts about how people were told they had to replace their whole steering column, I was overjoyed to find this replacement part.  It is actually better quality than the original part and it fits BETTER.  The column shifter used to be difficult to move to the Park position and after the old one snapped in half and I installed this new one, the shifter moves smoothly to all positions.  I highly recommend this part and it wasn't very hard to install."
positive,Pain in the butt to install these on my 08 heritage softail. Bolt holes don’t wanna line up and the rubber needs glue or something
negative,"When we opened the package, a broken bolt head fell out. The piece of the arm that bolt should have held in was missing altogether. It was also not a matching part for the original."
positive,Got this to put on the Polaris while we plow as it turns in the street. Works great! Very bright and easy to use with the magnet.
positive,I had temporary tags from the dealership blow off because they just print them on slightly thicker paper and that’s not very durable.  They sent me replacement tags so I bought this to cover it until my license plates came and it was perfect!
positive,great price and they look good on my 96 4runner.
positive,Was able to use my floor jack with no worries
positive,The deliver  is so fast.  I  am very happy.
positive,ok
positive,I've installed these on 2 different vehicles as backup lights.  They're great.
positive,"Does the job, great quality, good price."
negative,It can only be used when plugged into the car.
positive,no problems at all
positive,"This license plate is very well made, and sturdy.  It’s a great perk to be able to pick which color flag looks best with your vehicle."
positive,Lock it or loose it
positive,Easdy to install; better than OEM!
positive,Great transaction and quality product
positive,They are great.  Nice and bright
positive,Works fantastic!  Never had so much heat. Received item quickly & safely.
positive,"A little tall, fits my sports bike with a squeezed but my cruiser perfectly"
positive,"Got this for my 17 Pilot and it's a great alternative to getting one at the dealer.  High quality, less expensive, and easy to swap out yourself."
positive,This light was difficult to install in my trailer / tow hitch<br /><br />The retention pin holes are tight and the frame is short making it difficult to access the cotter pin
negative,Not Recommend it!...
positive,These things really work.  A lot of people think they are a gimmick....NO
positive,"Fits my Dodge Ram 1500 standard bed without a problem.  Kept me dry during a rain storm.  Seems to be solidly built.<br />It's not difficult to set up, however I would advise setting it up at home the first time in order to familiarize yourself with it."
positive,Easy to use. Product was as described.
positive,this is loud!  I bought a cheaper horn earlier and it made it 5 months.  It was near this loud and you can tell this is a quality horn.
negative,"I paid $21.99 for my Mr Funnel AF3CB fuel filter and it is less now.  This filter works well to remove any debris from an old container of gas.  Old gas, filtered and mixed with some fresh gas allows me to dispose of fuel that I would other wise have to find a place to take it to for disposal.  The lawn mower is none the worse, so far.  I just mix up partial tank and see how it runs, if good, I'll burn it.  If not I mix in more fresh fuel.  Works for me."
positive,Good wheels at an inexpensive price
positive,"Just plug in ,turn on.Saves all settings. I leave plugged in until needed, battery in unit stays charged. Some vehicles must set for half and hour to get rid of electricity in wiring, computer? Anyway instructions say to wait,not just turn off vehicle, then plug in right away."
negative,Good quality.
positive,"I read these reviews of increased intake noise and increased mileage and I have to say that for my application which is a 2011 Ram 1500 4.7l 4x4 there was no increase in the intake growl or noise, and further, there was no mileage increase. Well, no more than you would expect from replacing a stock oem filter that had 20k on it with a fresh clean one. However, the product is top notch and well worth the price and I completely recommend it."
negative,"It's pretty  holds water bottle ,umbrella, tissue box.  but trash area is very very small it dose hold medical masks so thumbs up for that."
positive,Awesome looking decal.  I got a white one and put on a black truck and it looks amazing.  Easy to apply and no air bubbles.  I get asked all the time where I got it.
negative,"Does it’s job but has no scent.. Didn’t smell anything when I took it out the box so figured it wouldn’t.. I’m assuming it has a shelf life for actually having a scent and if you get one that’s been sitting your SOL.. Wish it had a scent but not the end of the world, it works, is what it is..."
positive,We just lost our rat terrier beagle mix and this picture resembled her enough I wanted it for a keepsake!
positive,Can make a government gas can into a gas can that works!
positive,"Except for the fact that a neighbor received this, and kindly delivered it to me today,  the box is what I hoped it would be."
positive,"I did a drain & fill twice for the used Ridgeline I bought that the ATF was looking weak. It had no problems shifting before and is still shifting great with this Maxlife. I did research and a lot of Honda owners like this better than the Honda ATF. Ex. Pilot, Ridgeline, Odyssey & other non-Cvt."
positive,I installed these windshield wipers before the rainy season.  It's now raining and they are working like a charm.  They are quiet and leave no streaks.  Time will tell how well they hold up.  So far so good!
negative,Spare
positive,Convenient option for your CTEK charger. Good quality.
positive,Great buy but needed the whole thing for my bike but this will be spare
positive,Just like OEM.
positive,Need yet try more areas but great at ones so far
positive,"takes chlorine taste out, perfect"
positive,I really like this tray. I am a delivery driver and it is really helpful. I think it is a little overpriced and not quite as sturdy as I thought it would be but it really works well!! I would totally recommend it for people who often carry food and drinks in their passenger seat!
positive,"People weren't joking when they said these things are brittle. Just attaching the base cracked it a little. Nothing major, it still works as it should, but even though I was being careful I still cracked it a little. Not gonna knock a star for that though they might wanna consider making it out of a different type of plastic."
positive,TOTALLy works for keeping my golf cart windshield “beading” just like my car.
positive,Christmas gift for my son. He loves them. They are super sharp looking.
positive,Excellent quality.
negative,It doesn't fit for ML350
positive,My Honda dealer wanted to replace this filter for me in my car and wanted to charge me about $75 to do that.  I found this at a much better price and took about 5 min total to replace it in my car.  Would never allow a dealer to do something that is this easy to replace or repair for this price.  Saved enough to have a night on the town.
positive,"Worked as advertised, still functioning"
negative,"This works roughly as designed.  It's easy to install and easy to use.  Find the right grommets in the package, attach to steering wheel, use the IR (not RF) remote to turn it on, and the car looks and to some degree acts protected.  Unfortunately, the design makes it very easy to kill the batteries also... or essentially counter-intuitive to avoid killing them.  If you lock it shut (closed), it's waiting for the IR.  If you unlock it, it won't stay on the wheel.  So not so good for an RV where you may want to leave it on the wheel but turned off for extended times."
positive,But it does come in handy on a trip to just put your trash in there and empty when you get to a gas station or somewhere there is a big trash can. It does work fine for what it is suppose to be.
positive,"My husband bought this for my outback. He was really impressed with the quality, that it came with everything you need and the fact that it came with directions! Great quality."
positive,"When you have a crazy connection on your jack like the Kia does, this is mandatory."
positive,very pleased
positive,Maybe sell them in a four pack?
positive,"If you have faded or (in my case) sand blasted plastic from the Alaska Highway, this stuff will add back that &#34;showroom&#34; look as long as you don't get out there with a microscope and look closely. The stand-off result is really good. It WILL stain. So heed the instructions and wear some good nitrile gloves to keep the finger tips clean. Sort of goes on like a liquid shoe dye. Then after a few minutes just use a microfiber towel (that you will never use again) and wipe 'er down. Wa-La!"
positive,This decals are made of high quality materials. The size is perfect! I used them on my sports helmet and other sports equipment.
positive,As advertised.
negative,Didn't work at all.. .
negative,Must have two existing keys for this to be functional but it doesn't say that anywhere in the product description of questions.
negative,It doesn't fit like it should. Looks incredibly cheap
negative,"Despite being the correct size, these just don't fit tightly enough.  There is no retention to them whatsoever.  If you place them in the wheel the slightest touch will cause them to fall out.  The ones that came pre-installed in my new wheels have to be pulled out with considerable effort.  I thought these would be higher-quality than the pre-installed ones, and they do seem to be well-made, but these would be so easy to lose whenever you removed a wheel to rotate, etc that it's not worth it.  In fact, as loose as they are it makes me question if they truly are the correct size.  They don't wiggle when installed, but still."
positive,"After measuring my hand size and ordering these at 2xL I was a bit let down that they were still really tight while bending my fingers in the gloves , so I gave they away to a friend , Product looks to be well built and would last for what I needed them for"
positive,Made a big difference in starting. Turns faster than the old stock starter.
positive,"right fit for vehicle, works well."
positive,"Our travel trailer has one of those raised bubble skylights over the bathtub. And no ac vents in the bathroom. This is just a heat magnet in summer, especially in the Chihuahua Desert. It was literally 111 degrees (12% humidity) yesterday and 110 degrees, real air temp today. The bathroom has been HOT.<br /><br />I installed this cover over the skylight frame this morning. The velcro attachment means no drilling! Yay! It fit perfectly and completely covered the stupid skylight opening. No gaps.<br /><br />Yesterday at 6pm in the absolute worst of the heat - 111 degrees - our bathroom was 90 degrees. The rest of the RV was holding at 82. Today though, 110 degrees outside at 6pm and 82 degrees in the main trailer....the bathroom has held at 84 degrees!!! Still hot of course, but significantly better considering the surface of the sun temperature outside."
positive,Exact replacement
positive,This kit worked wonders on a deep scratch on my front bumper. I had visited several car supply stores and could not find a color close enough to hide the scratch. This paint is formulated to match exactly. It was easy to use and worked great. Now no one can see where the garage attacked my car.
positive,"Easy installation, with the right tool, which. Amazon sell.."
positive,Does what is says.
positive,👍👍👍👍🤩🤩🤩🤩
negative,"One of the first things int he directions are to locate the hanger straps on the front corners of the cover.  Don't bother, they are not there.  In fact, the only hanger straps are located on each side.  There is nothing to hold the cover up, as described in the picture.  Save yourself some headaches, go to the hardware store and purchase some tarp clamp and bungee cords.  This is the only way it will hang in place.  Common sense tells you if you want to hang a square, you need four points to hang it.  One on each corner.  This cover requires magic, which was not included.  Other than that, the material is good quality, the zipper seems good quality, the straps are sufficient.  For the money though, it is over priced due to the amount of extra money you have to spend to get it to work correctly.  The instructions were great, they just did not apply."
positive,Bought for my 02 yukon.  Fit great
positive,Good
positive,"I received this product free through the vine voice program.<br /><br />Pros<br />Can insert the stakes at different levels so gravity helps things move<br />Protects the hose by keeping it off the ground from critters and kinks<br /><br />A good handy product for your Rv , that will help you save money buy helping your sewer hose to last"
positive,We've used this product for years. It is by the far the best window cleaner - any window. We use it on mirrors and windows. Does not streak.
negative,I've bought cheaper led bulbs that are brighter than this which is why 3 stars.  It is brighter than halogen but not as bright as I was expecting (the old one burnt out and it was cheaper and brighter).
positive,"AMAZING! They are super bright, great color and easily installed!"
positive,"I'm a long time fan of Pink Floyd and I bought this design for my car. It's well made, but take your time applying it!"
positive,"To start with, I had to remove the skid plate that came with my 4Runner, which was pretty tough. Once that was off, it was really difficult to get the brackets to fit to the frame. The holes didn't quite line up properly, and there was edges of the underneath of my car that I had to bend just to get it close to fitting, then had to force it and eventually got it to set up. Once the brackets were on, attaching the grille guard to the brackets was a breeze. And it looks pretty sweet. I just hope that I never have to deal w/ taking it off or re-fitting it..."
negative,"I hear this stuff is good but it won't work for your helical or torsen diff.  Probably shouldn't use for an open diff either.  Too thick for a manual transmission.  Basically, unless you have a clutch type diff, which almost no car or truck has, don't use this stuff.  It has friction modifiers in it.  Wish they wouldn't make everything with that crap in it"
negative,The filter arrived crushed and could not be used.
positive,"Showed up on time, that well, and holds the bumper cover as it should. It was a good price and it installed easily."
positive,Nothing not to like. Built like all Dewalt products so much so I bought 2. One for me one for my son.
positive,"My Outback is now fifteen years old, so it has a lot of old, worn clips which have been subjected to 150k miles in all four seasons and numerous removals and reinsertions. It is nice to be able to service the car without needing to worry about getting all the old, brittle plastic clips out in one piece, and to just replace the old clips with new ones before the break. Won't know how durable these are for a few years, but there's enough here to outlast the car, most likely."
positive,Great
positive,"VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED how quick it inflated the tire.  I had a tire that was at 20psi and it inflated it to 30psi in under 3 minutes!  There's not a ""start"" button, which was confusing, but I was too lazy to read instructions.  Pump started after I turned it off and back on."
positive,perfect fit
positive,Easy to install. Easy to read.
positive,"Quality of fan is good. Product does not work for what I need it for, it was bought for horse trailer. The fan will not pivot enough to blow down on horse, even if it did there wouldn't be enough airflow to cool down horses."
positive,Fuses seem to be of decent quality and there's plenty of them so you shouldn't need to buy fuses again for a few years unless you burn through one specific size fuse and run out but if that happens then you've got a problem that probably needs to be checked out by a professional<br /><br />BC
positive,"Quality running boards, took 25 min to install. They look really sharp."
positive,My rear of the vehicle looked like a tornado had hit it. This was easy to install and corrected the chaos. The material is strong and stitching is strong. Looks to last a long time. Great value for your money.
positive,It really takes away hard orders and smells good
positive,These LED spotlights are great! They are heavy duty and work well. I installed one on the front and one on the back of my boats T-TOP. They are WAY better than the weak stock lights that came with the top!  I use the rear light to back the boat down the ramp when its dark and it lights up the WHOLE area! This was a great deal!
positive,Original struts were on an ARE cap installed on my Toyota pickup nearly 20 years ago. they have been broken at least 8-10 years and I have been using a prop to hold the cap door up. Less than 5 minute to install new ones. tonight I have a prop burning party!
positive,Great polish especially on black metallic sapphire 2017 BMWs.Hard to find anything that is better and I have tried almost everything.
negative,"Received as a gift.  Decent construction, but the ring that attaches to the wallet is much to large in my opinion. The main thing I didn't like, though, was the thickness of the chain. I was hoping for something thinner."
positive,Easy to install. Looks great.
positive,Just what I needed
positive,"This steering wheel was a pain to install, but that is not unusual. It feels comfortable, no harsh seams that catch. Stays in place well.<br /><br />The fabric is almost too smooth, it sometimes feels like my hands will slid on the fabric. There are two section that have a slight texture, but they don't help the gripability any."
negative,"I think it is Good for wire rim sunglasses.<br />I have width horn-rimmed sunglasses... they are warped. Those legs of my sunglasses' frame can't be on the same position.<br />As you can see the pic. one leg is front, but another is rear in the visor. No good for the horn-rimmed."
positive,I really liked these led bulbs. They were the perfect white/bluish color that I was looking for. And the brightness made a huge difference. I will be buying a second pair to have just in case one of the leds goes out. Great product!
positive,Really soft and close completely so no exposed Velcro
positive,Wrote an article in the region Porsche magazine highlighting the bracket.  Will save me any future ticket for not having a front license plate.  Very well made and comes on and off very easy.
positive,"I have a 2010 rav4 and it’s a little small for full coverage, but it’s mostly covered and it’s held up well over the past year in Texas. Can’t tell if it’s doing as good a job as a generic one, but it’s better than nothing. Holds in place with the sun visors. Haven’t used the suction cups."
negative,Wire is horrible to thin
positive,Overall a really nice product. I wanted to add some to my car but didnt want to add alot of weight. Compared to other brands this is lighter. Seems to be close to the same thickness too. Easy to install. Use a wooden roller and a heat gun. The heat gun is used to warm up the surface so the mat sticks good. It can also warm the mat and make It more pliable for corners or bends.
positive,ok
positive,"Fit my 2006 F150 XLT, looks slick, very nice appearance."
positive,Best aftermarket lights I’ve ever purchased!
positive,It is hard to roll small to store but it is so substantial it is worth it.
positive,"Wow! No kidding, this stuff is like magic! Rub it on, wipe it off, and scratches are suddenly invisible. Forgot to take the &#34;before&#34; pictures, but others have posted them in their reviews. Believe it! Incredibly easy. I used the &#34;Viking Cotton Terry Wax Applicator Pads,&#34; also sold here, but I suspect a white cotton T-Shirt would have worked as well. Super happy with the results! Before you pay a fortune having minor - but ugly - scratches fixed at a body shop, try this product. I could not be more pleased!"
positive,Perfect
positive,Excellent!  Just what we needed for our daughters protection. She is 7 and is her 1st 4 wheeler. Sturdy and rugged.
negative,"I bought this device and tested it. It worked just as advertised. So I carry it around everywhere in my little wallet pouch, just in case I leave it around the house. Well, the other day I did. So I smugly turned on my iPad and opened the app. Unfortunately, the device was disconnected and could not be found. I did eventually find my wallet and tried reconnecting the device with no success. I contacted support several days ago and haven't heard back.<br />It seems that the device works for some people, but you certainly can't rely on it. For me, it isn't worth carrying around an extra fob that may or may not work when I need it. And it certainly isn't worth $40.<br />I strongly recommend avoiding this product."
positive,"I am not certain what these do, but our mechanic specifically told me to order these so I am guessing they are the best option on Amazon. Hes quite knowledgeable about mercs so I took this as a good sign."
positive,"My rust bucket rides so much better with these struts,great product and great price."
positive,got these on sale so I stocked up
positive,Got my diesel pump resealed and no leaks.  Fairly easy to install.
positive,"I'm a former ASE certified tech. So I'm used to factory higher end obd2 readers. These do just fine for your basic readers. I just wish there was little more options where I could see more system functions and what not. Even if it's a option that I would have to pay for, i would.<br />But again as a basic scan tool it reads what i needed it to. I have 3 scan tools here. One cheaply $20-30 pocket reader (only reads engine lights), fox well 930 (engine, srs, abs), and this.<br />Trying to read the srs code on a 2006 f150 and this read the code immediately. The fox well sometimes read it or couldn't connect. Then when it did gave multiple codes. I had my friend at ford scan it for me and it was only 1 code so the autel worked perfectly, foxwell not so much adding 4 codes total"
positive,As advertised
positive,"Seems to work, but does required disassemble of the carburetor.  Cleaned out the carburetor<br />gum in just a few seconds."
positive,"My Audi is designed such that when you have beverages in the holder you can’t open the middle storage. With these wedged in the passenger seat, I have access to all the things in my middle storage compartment. Very handy"
positive,They look great .....
positive,Works great
positive,Made well.<br />Good size at 6 gallons.<br />Kinda wish it had a gauge. Others do but for more $$<br />This IS worth the $$$
positive,Great price!  It's nice to be able to change the filter for 1/4th the price that a car repair shop charges!
positive,"this also looks nice in the back window, of my truck"
positive,Used this to touch up my 2016 Toyota Corolla.  Thank you.
positive,Easy to install and instant speed.  Quite impressed with the pedal to speed responsiveness.  I do notice a higher use of fuel when in Sport & Sport+.  But still love it.  Highly recommend if you want quick to speed response.
negative,"The description states that it fits a window that is 31.5&#34;-47&#34;. My window is 31&#34; and it doesn't even fit that. The packaging states 31&#34; is the max, so not only are the shades way smaller than the description, they're smaller than the package states as well. I don't recommend these at all, and when you shop other brands be sure to actually read the reviews and not just the star rating as many of them are padded by compensated reviews. I didn't and got these substandard shades. My bad."
positive,"After the first tank of gas, it immediately gave me a boost of 3 mpg. For the price and ease of use, this can't be beat!"
positive,Love these shoes!
positive,Shine satys
negative,"Just received these an hour ago. You get what you pay for. These do in fact dissipate 6.15 Watts@12.3V  as a pair. About 3 watts each. Since the efficiency is not listed, I will guess that they are about 75 - 80 lumens per Watt.  So 450-480 lumens as a pair. Light color is narrow-band daylight.<br /><br />They have no lens and are omni-directional so, THEY CANNOT BE USED AS DRIVING OR FOG LIGHTS without a focusing lens or reflector.<br /><br />The 18 inch hook-up wires are very thin, I would guess 28 gauge or smaller.<br /><br />At 12.3 Volts they got to hot to touch after just 15 minutes. Not sure how well these would work on a plastic car bumper for extended periods of no airflow.<br /><br />Fun toys but they are nothing more than toys.  The pair of these will light up the boot of my car very nicely.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:<br />I tested these for a couple hours with a current limiting resistor and they stay cold.  My kit bag only had a 7ohm 50W in it.  But If I did the calculations correctly, these need to be limited to  210mA of current so they stay cold. I calculated the load at 55 ohms. I measured the car voltage at 13.8V. So a 5W dropping resistor of 10 ohms should do the trick to keep these from melting your car bumper.<br /><br />These do only dissipate 2.4 Watts together as a pair if a proper limiting resistor is used. Still pretty bright, but not the same as when they dissipate 6 Watts and burn things.<br /><br />USE AT YOUR OWN RISK"
negative,The rubber wiper blade itself keeps sliding out of the groove when its raining and the wipers are on and you end up with half a blade in the wiper housing?  Its only on the passenger side too.  I had to super glue the blade to the housing just to keep it from sliding out.  They wipe fine when they are in place but I will not buy them again because of the problems with the blade sliding out..
positive,Exactly what I needed
positive,"Got package to day truck cover , unfortunately  some how maybe me , but had my truck model size etc. Said would fit have to return, . But looking it over , I've  had at least five different covers over the years . The packaging and it could be mounted because instead of usual put everything together yourself , any one who ever put a barbeque grill together knows what I mean , worth that alone  it<br /><br /> . This is 80% ASSEMBLED . ORDER CORRECT ONE , with out even shipping wrong size back , no hesitatation after seeing quality ."
positive,I drive a 2006 Honda Accord coupe and it has been impossible for me to find wipers that get the spot at the bottom and middle part of the wind shield. I regularly change the wipers so it isn't because they were just old. It also isn't because the wiper mechanism doesn't work. This blade works perfectly and is the absolute best fit for my car.
positive,"I saved $$$ by buying my replacement key from here, thank you"
positive,"I got exhausted looking at all the new bulbs that fit my car! Prices from $20 to $120!! I kept looking at specs trying to figure out what was best for the best price! Finally landed on these. They are great! Super price, really bright! I have a 2010 Equinox with those low old amber lights. On dark roads they really sucked! Popped these in & wow! 😳 Amazing different!! Not to hard to install, if you're car savvy, super easy, if not a little tricky. Well worth it!"
negative,Does not match the profile of the nissan titan xd<br />Had to cut a piece to make it fit<br />Adhesive not strong enough<br />I am concerned about removing it and damaging my truck
positive,Great for grand babies that get hot in the car.
negative,"Do Not Buy This Product, it does not work, on none of my three cars."
negative,"In the 2022 Audi Q5, this attaches only to two straight pegs at the top. If you snag a package on the net when removing it, the whole net comes off. That's largely the fault of the cargo hook design but useful for Q5 owners looking to purchase to know."
positive,Worked great with our Scion and our JVC kw-510HDT head unit. No issues. worked right out of the box.
positive,Good price
negative,"Cleaning out a rusty gas tank is the 2nd $#i##iest jobs you'll ever do in life. The only thing worse is having to clean this tank sealer out of the inside because it doesn't adhere. So, the prep involved this: cleaned my tank with vinegar (soaked for 3 days, emptied 1/2, added hex nuts and shook vigorously about 1,000 times, emptied, rinsed, repeated 3 times). After the final rinse, I dried the inside with a heatgun for about 20 minutes until the inside was bone dry. Waited one our, then used their cleaner and tank prep as instructed. Again dried with heat gun and let sit overnight. Next day, applied ""tank sealer"" exactly as instructed, rolling it around inside the tank, and emptying out all the excess. Two day later, I go to check it and I look inside with a flashlight to see that it is peeling all over the inside of the tank. Now I get to do this whole procedure again! You can only imagine my glee!!! ...only this time it's far worse - much harder to remove AND if I don't get it all, I'm sure to be plagued with blocked fuel flow over and over again, as big slabs of peeled paint will block things up far worse than the rust I was originally trying to remove.<br />Update 4/11/2021: Sent detailed email to POR15 via their website 3 weeks ago. THEY NEVER EVEN RESPONDED. All in all, I spent an unbelievable number of hours fashioning tools and scraping this crap out of the inside of the tank. Nightmare. After scraping out all that I could, there were some areas of the tank that were coated and some that were not. At that point, I had no choice but to buy a second pint of sealer. I'm now $100 into this and about 20 miserable hours. Applied in the same manner as the first time. The second application has not yet peeled after 4 days, but the surface is very lumpy inside where some of the 1st coat could not be removed, but I am hopeful that it is at least sealed. This was a disaster. I will NEVER do this again, nor would I recommend any of the POR15 products. I've had similar issues with their original chassis paint peeling. Also POR15 can't be finished over. Recommend Chassis Saver. Better product that can be top coated with automotive finish."
positive,"Very good product and works well. The only negative is that the frame of the visor is only at the top. So if it stay in a hot car during summer months, the sides tend to curl up making it not so effective. Once it cools down it will regain its shape. But if you are out and about, it may be more distracting then helpful.<br />If it had a frame that went completely around the edge, it would keep its natural curved shape permanently. Otherwise it does the job of filtering sun glare."
negative,Returned it.  Looks like I would work well but is was so tiny it would It hold very much.
positive,good stuff
positive,Good price and quality item.
positive,good
negative,"I had these on my 2010 Camry.  I believe they were 215/60r16's.  They road smooth, no degradation of ride quality versus the BFG's that were on there from the factory.  However, they were NOISY highway noise was crazy, worse on the fresh blacktop.<br /><br />Best way to describe it is if you've ever seen those huge balloons businesses inflate and fly like 50-60ft in the air, the sound of filling one of those from a helium tank without the nifty little cone-shaped plastic push valve but filling by turning the knob on the top and blowing directly into the balloon.<br /><br />Exactly that loud hissing noise expanding the latex, but on the tires, it was slightly muted.  Probably because the Camry was an ultra quiet car."
negative,No smell and clip broke as soon as opened
positive,Excellent product.  It arrived on time and worked as advertised.
negative,I bought these because I read online reviews that these are the very best available.  I beg to differ.  Anytime there is icy rain -- these freeze up and the ice gets stuck.  I have to wack at them to get it off.  They streak.  They are noisy.<br />I bought similar ones for my wife's car which seem to work better -- but as for me - I will not be waiting for them to get old -- will be replacing asap.
positive,"I received it on time. It fit the steering wheel perfectly. I followed the directions and it stitched up nice and smug on the first pass. Snugged it up again and it looks like a professional installation. I got two needles and threads, but I only needed one. Easy installation. Would highly recommend."
positive,OEM part for less than aftermarket.  You won't find a better deal!  Thanks!
positive,"These match my interior (Subaru grey) and protect my seats from the kicker in the car seat behind me.  Easy to install, very straight forward.  If you have found these you are obviously looking.  Go ahead and pick these up."
positive,"Okay, I realize that I needed this for an unconventional reason, but it was a dream come true for what I needed it for. I have the Pure juicer, which, if you are familiar with, is a BIG juicer that is also very heavy (70+ pounds). It needs a tray like this, with these dimensions, under it, so you can catch any drips or spills and also to help 'slide' the machine around, as needed, to clean the area and this fit the bill amazingly! Thank you so much. I can imagine that it would be useful for any number of things as well."
positive,Quite pleased! This addition to our new vehicle has been quite helpful already in &#34;keeping the place nice and tidy&#34;. We're not using the strap and it seems to be just fine sitting up on its own on the floorboard of the passenger side of our 2014 Nissan Rogue.
positive,Sucks like a cheap hoe
positive,"This cargo netting has several uses. I was planning on using it as a garden trellis because of its large size and durability. It comes with 12 carabiners to attach (but they arent very good quality in my opinion). You could also use zip ties or other clips if you have them available. It doesn't get tangled and has a lot of stretch to it. I've only been using this product for about a month, so I can't comment on the long term durability of it. It seems like it will hold up, but I will update if I have anything else to add, or if I experience any issues!"
positive,"I have 4 deep cycle batteries I've been using for powering 12V wenches as well as an inverter. I wanted to be able to isolate the batteries from each other in case 1 battery went bad and shorted, as well as protect batteries from an external short. Currently using a 100 amp battery charger but eventually I will be installing several solar panels for charging.<br /><br />This so far seems perfect for the job. I connected each battery to it's own breaker then connected output of each breaker together. I connect to the output of the breakers for power as well as for charging batteries. This also works as an on/off switch as well, with a push of the breaker button the breaker disconnects the battery, push the side lever and breaker is reset to on.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was different is the tab next to the breaker's posts, it limits the angle you can connect the wire to the post. Without the tab there I could use a straight copper buss bar to connect all of the outputs instead of needing something that loops around it."
positive,"I had bought two other brands of gauges and returned them as one was leaking and the other was inaccurate. This Auto Meter gauge is almost twice as much money but it reeks with quality. It arrives with its own plastic case, large easy to read dial, the hose has a braided covering with what looks like well made fittings and the air relief button feels well built. This is not my first Auto Meter air gauge. I still have my old one 0-100 pounds and it still is in great working condition. My reason for buying a new one is that I wanted a gauge to more exactly read automobile and bicycle tires. With its one pound increments the Auto Meter 0-60 pound gauge fills that niche."
positive,Had some problems with priming. Talked to support and they sent out a new one right away. Second one worked great. Great support. Great product once I got past the priming issue.
positive,"It isn't the biggest unit I have ever seen to charge a battery, but it does work, and it does tell you it is working with the green light.  You can't overcharge your battery, so  you can leave it on for months.  I have a Toyota Solara which I only occasionally drive, so I need something to protect the battery from drainage of power.  This little critter does the job.  The clamps are a little small, but they do grip the terminal ends all right.  The cord is relatively short, so you have to have an extension cord.  I guess to compensate for this, they have decent length cables that connect to the battery.  The whole unit is lightweight; I guess the only down side might be that it doesn't charge very quickly; it takes a while (like more than a day for me) to put any meaningful charge into the battery.  But, if you want is something to maintain an already healthy battery, this is it.  It's also relatively cheap compared to the other units on the market."
negative,Work great. Only issue is insulation has cracked in several spots after use in cold. Perhaps while so inexpensive. Simple fix with liquid tape but still annoying.<br /><br />Gave that set of cables to friend. Ordered cables from another seller and an trying them out.<br /><br />Would not buy this brand again...
positive,"INTALLS IN A SECOND (MAGNET). USED ON BACK OF VEHICLES.  LETS ME HOOK UP WITH OTHER VETS AT CAR SHOWS ,ETC"
negative,"Everything the other negative reviewers reported in spades! I followed directions in the videos completely. And, what I got was a hazy car that looked like hell in the sun. I will never buy this product again and wish that I could get my money back. Absolute garbage! And, I expect much, much more from Meguiar's!"
positive,very good fit
positive,"Excellent quality, perfect fit and works well! Way better pricing than the dealership!"
positive,Very Good.
positive,works for solenoid replacement on 2000 gmc yukon xl 1500 5.3L
positive,The grommets weather and the linkage falls off. It's difficult to install by yourself.
positive,Works perfect. 2010 highlander.
positive,Well worth the money. These are very big.
positive,I used them in my husbands truck
positive,Easy to install. Instructions to remove old wipers. Will buy again.
positive,"This ashtray works great outdoors. The spring on the clamp is nice and strong, and you can clip onto whatever you have handy. If you want to use it in your car, be aware that although it has a lid, it doesn’t seal, so the smells can still escape."
positive,"Priced well fit right in, no problems"
positive,Item delivered on time and was as described.
positive,nice
positive,"I had dropped my last key fob and it stopped working I was so upset for a new fob replacement it was going to be $300 and I was very reluctant to buy this, but I went ahead and did. Thankfully I was able to take out the chip board out and place it in the new fob and it works great. No problems, glad I went this route saved me lots of money. If your cip board is damaged idk that it will work like it did with mine."
positive,does the job
positive,nice looking sticker
negative,Have received 2 cans of this so far and both have issues spraying.  The lube turns white on my chain like I am spaying lithium grease on it.  Won't buy it a 3rd time
positive,This is a great sun shade. Still lets the air in and protects the driver as well as the interior.
positive,So glad  chose these -- makes the back seat neater and  my family loves them
positive,Stronger than original and direct hole fit.<br />Would recommend!
negative,Did not line up well. Contacted seller o get refund twice and did not get a reply. Yhis alone tells you not to do business with them. We got them installed and they do work fine. The lens appears cheap and i my opinion will yellow quicker than competing headlights.
positive,"Well, this is great.  I bought a pair of sensors for my car years ago, but only changed one out since they were such a nightmare to remove.  Thankfully, that fixed my fault code, but with this, I was able to fairly painlessly change out the other.  Just need the right tools."
positive,Bought these for a vehicle that was in desperate need for new brakes and extremely happy with this brand.  Work great and no noise!! Doesnt appear to create much dust and honestly I purchased the front and rear set combined on Amazon for much less than I would have paid at the local parts house for just the front or rear seat individually.
positive,"Bought these to replace the locks on my camper.  It does work fine, but they are not as snug I was was hoping for.  I love the keys they’re so easy to use compared to old locks I had.  The locks also seem to be very sturdy, just don’t quite fit 100% (but could have been my error installing them). Install was easy though. I would buy these again, the price makes it a no brained"
positive,I have not installed this filter yet but it seems to be ok.  I did not rate the sheerness because I don't know what it means.
positive,great product
positive,"Overall I like the vacuum... for the sale price. Had I paid full price for it I would probably not be as happy, because, I'm sorry, but there's no way this thing is picking up a soccer ball. And the fact that my unit came scuffed up, which I'm miffed about.<br /><br />However, thankfully I didn't need the vacuum to pick up a soccer ball and scuffing doesn't have any effect on function.<br /><br />I particularly like the brush end that comes with this. I've purchased other car vacs in the past with cheap, glued on brushes that broke off after one use. This isn't one of those kinds of car vacs.<br /><br />I had no problem at all cleaning the floors in my Nissan Versa and having a dog and a ten year old child, they get pretty nasty sometimes.<br /><br />The dolphin tail thing, realistically won't get much use just because I have such a small car and it's not an easy thing to maneuver in such a small space, though it is a neat feature of the vacuum.<br /><br />Four stars only because I am still a bit irritated that I received a product that was scuffed up. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy."
positive,Fits perfectly in my 08 HSE RR. You'll want to have a few washers handy and probably 2-4 of those adhesive rubber numbers. I had to use the washers to snug up the fit between the bracket and the vehicle.
positive,"Purchased 2 sets of these for our boat trailer.  So far, they are holding up quite nicely.  They were just as described and easy to install."
negative,"Doing well except the one that i am using full time, now and then does not lock/unlock the doors on the first push of the button. Out of my two original remotes one was less reliable in this same manner but the new one is not as bad."
positive,"quick delivery time, cap was a perfect match and worked as intended."
positive,Works good
positive,"Perfect fit, great quality. Bought a 2nd one, would buy again and again. Clasps nicely, and super comfortable. Integrated visor is great. Buy it!"
positive,"I use these to repair a sewer hose that develops a pin hole leak. No sense throwing the hose away, just cut it at the leak and add these, which extends the life of the hose."
negative,Works
positive,"Installed this on a 2013 JKU. Did not come with H4 to H13 adapter as is necessary for the install. Contacted seller and got that resolved.<br /><br />Direct fit into the stock positions. Much brighter than stock bulbs and has very distinct cut off for easy adjustments.<br /><br />Warranty is for 12 months. Replacement will ship from China, so keeping the original headlights might be a good idea for equipment as critical as headlights."
positive,"I've had a lot of chamois over the  years and aside from some being a little thicker, and others a little thinner, they are all pretty much the same. This is well made and I'll be ordering again when I inevitably lose this one (I keep them in instrument cases for polishing finishes).<br /><br />I gave it a quick rinse when it arrived, per the instructions, but I don't think it was strictly necessary. This didn't come oily like some chamois."
positive,The magnet is strong enough! This makes serving my 900 RZR trail much easier... I couldn't imagine having to switch a belt out while out in the field without out it. The model has very tight working conditions....
positive,Ordered with Raybestos PGD1522C Professional Grade Ceramic Brake shoes for my 2011 Chevrolet Cruze.  Took less then a hour to remove and replace with new and the difference was very noticeable. Very Happy and will purchase again if ever needed although I expect the car will have been traded in long before I have to replace again!!
positive,Good to warm your hands with on a cold morning but not really powerful enough when it gets really cold to help clear or defrost your window.
positive,VERY NICE
positive,Used it on my 2000 Ram Van and am very pleased with the quality and price.
negative,"Do not buy. Very bright, but one is out after a month."
positive,"I had intended to buy a high capacity jump starter for some time for use on the farm.  I was prompted to go ahead and get one a few months ago because the batteries on my Dodge Ram 3500 have reached the point that they will hold a charge for only a few days -- some times the truck may set a week without being used.  Since the vehicle starts fine when used regularly, I didn't want to buy a new pair of batteries till I had to.<br /><br /> I have been amazed at the power that this jump starter delivers.  It starts my truck's relatively big Diesel engine every bit as easily as new batteries would.<br /><br />Only one minor complaint:  The cables on the jump starter lack a couple of feet being long enough to reach from the ground to the battery on my truck.  This is a minor problem -- I simply set it on the bumper.<br /><br />As I said, I have owned this jump starter only a few months.  If future problems occur, I will amend this rating."
positive,This fuse tap worked well form y 2013 Honda civic. It took a few time to get it to stay. Kept pooping out but after i got the wire positioned the way i wanted it there was no preload on the fuse itself so it has stayed for over a month without popping out. Product works well for add on circuits.
positive,This was a filter for my Honda Shadow. Fram filters seem of quality construction And service was amazingly fast. Anazon Prime is the way to go on items like this or things you would have to drive around and search for.
positive,This replacement worked great on the stabilizer system for my camper. But<br />My old switch was in a round hole but the new switch was a rectangle so I had to modify it to fit. Also I had to add male flat ends to the 4 wires to attach to my existing wiring . But this item worked perfectly once installed in about a total of 20-30 minutes .
negative,"These caps look good initially and function properly, but the black metal fades after a few weeks when exposed to sunlight."
positive,"Same price as stock replacement parts locally. Fits well, cannot say there is a braking improvement over stock"
positive,GREAT PRICE!  THANK YOU!!
positive,Great looking running lights!  I am very happy!
positive,"This is the second pair I've owned (actually I bought two this time around).  These glasses fit nicely with a full face helmet for motorcyclists and are lightweight for casual daily wear.  The padding inside the frame keeps a nice flow of air to keep lenses from fogging.  The lightweight design also keeps the wearer from ending up with dents in the nose pad areas after long wear.  The color/design is simple yet eye-catching.  These are sturdy and durable glasses.  I still have and wear the old ones when working the in yard.  Additionally, if you drop the glasses and the lens pops out, it is easily popped back in.  I highly recommend these to anyone looking for quality, durablity, style and an overall good value!"
positive,Works for my 2007 toyota matrix brake lights
positive,This is an excellent vehicle soap that easily removes grime and bugs. I also use this soap to clean the outside of the windows on my house.
positive,perfect
positive,Appears to be a great product however it does not expose the front hardware buttons on my HTC 4g LTE.  Other than that it was exactly what I wanted.
positive,Great product
positive,"Soft.<br /><br />Does not hold pebbles or rocks in the fibers.<br /><br />Scrubs the dirt away.<br /><br />Thick, so you don’t have pieces of it sticking through and scratching up the paint.<br /><br />Easy to clean and put away.<br /><br />I recommend this product."
positive,Direct replacement for my brittle factory one on my RV
negative,Rugged?  It's made out of some kind of paper material.  Ripped a hole just putting it on.  If I didn't need it so bad for a trip this week I'd send it back.
positive,Really like these. Made well and don't slip. Look good too.
positive,"[[VIDEOID:2a462c80800f8089fdb0381908dfa1b7]] I put these in my 2000 300M map lights and what a difference, highly recommend these to everyone."
positive,Fit Good easy setup attached with a tiewrap
positive,Great stopped for horse trailer windows n doors!<br />Easy to install
positive,Sturdy decal for the back windows of our vehicles.
positive,"This shade is a near perfect fit for the windshield on my 2021 Gladiator.<br /><br />Quality is okay, but it was pretty inexpensive. So no complaints from here. When it's time to put it away, it folds neatly into a small storage pouch that fits right in the glove compartment.<br /><br />I started parking outside and needed this. Overall, I'm happy with this order."
positive,It works just fine
negative,Difficult to open item. Tiny piece of double sided tape to stick to surface. Even on a very clean dry surface item refused to stick and kept falling off.
positive,These retainers work well. There isn't much to say. I needed them after I replaced head light bulb on a 2007 Accord.
positive,Easy installation and looks great
negative,"They work,, but if your looking for blue daytime running light color  look else where these are regular yellow light. Factory like."
negative,These are no better or worse than any other for the rear window wiper on my Vibe. I think in part because of the short size and the window wiper arm does not/cannot exert pressure like a windshield wiper does. It wipes clean for a while but then will start streaking.
positive,Good value. Best deal around.
positive,They are alright for the money you can’t beat it they are lil yellow and white
positive,Identical replacement. Toyota dealerships will rape you to the tune of $350 for the same part PLUS another $120 to install it. That's obscene. Buy this instead of dealing with Toyota.
positive,"Good for the price, classic appearance looks good on my retro bike."
positive,worked well
positive,"Simple to replace .,works well no leaks ."
positive,"Necessary tool for garden tractors, mowers, wheelbarrows and the like."
positive,Fit fine. Works well on the road
positive,Just as described
positive,It is excellent easy to use and fit for purpose
positive,Inexpensive brush set. I bought it to clean out my horses hooves before applying medicine. This brush works great to get into small areas.
positive,I use this to filter about 3-4 gallons of gasoline at a time for my mowers. I keep a 5 gallon can of filtered gasoline on hand most of the time. Can't tell how effective it is but I like to take every precaution I can to keep dirt and water out of my carbs.
positive,"This is a reasonably priced voltmeter (Multimeter) to be used for indoor basic household purposes.  As of this review it costs $17.99.  It's small and compact making carrying easier than the much larger multimeters.<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br />The inside fuse is very easy to replace although there is no place inside the voltmeter to store spares.<br />Battery compartment is easily accessible using a small Phillips head screwdriver.<br />The leads fit snugly into the voltmeter,  and the points are nice and long.  Endcaps are included to keep the points safe from damage.<br />Readouts are easy to see.  The display has large numbers.  But you will need your glasses to see the volt markings on the dial.<br /><br />What I wish it had:<br />A stand to hold it upright making viewing it easier.  As it is, it lays flat on it's back.<br />It comes with a 12v battery, but I would prefer it use a 9v battery for easier replacement.<br />No alligator clips are included which would have been a very nice extra.<br /><br />It will detect a live circuit (outlet) but it seems to register it better if something is plugged into the outlet but it doesn't have to be turned on.  (The voltmeter must be turned on.)  I tested an outlet here in my office with nothing plugged in and the light on the voltmeter would faintly flicker, but when I plugged in a lamp which was turned off the light on the meter came on very brightly.  I would always just assume it's a live circuit unless you know for sure you have cut off the power to it.  Overall, very useful for indoor household current measurements, but not made for HVAC work."
positive,"Great product, works and does exactly as expected (2007 Mustang)! Used as replacement for old remote, easy to program, comes with instructions"
positive,Perfect quick and no mess delivery. A lot of shipped oils and fluids come leaking and beat up. Perfect here and not one drop. Great oil and I already know how it performs as I have been using it in my Mercedes and Porsche for years with no engine issues.
positive,This mink oil is good quality. And I've oiled about all my leather items with good results.its een Raining out here in<br />SO CAL for past two weeks with more on the way so I don't think you'll find a better test!this oil gets A++ one thing that was a bit strange though was on its rating for review....they wanted to know how it fits? Im not really into slathering mink oil on my person! Lol works great on boots though! Lol God purchase👍
positive,Worked very well to charge my fish finder battery on my kayak.
positive,"Installed on my 04 Silverado 5.3l v8.  My guage had pegged all the way up to 80. Due to the location of the sensor, it was a tight squeeze to install. With the right socket, swivle and extention, install wasn't really that bad.  Shop quoted $180. I saved a bucket of cash doing it myself."
positive,"Towed our camper from Florida to Utah and back, so I have to say it's worked great!"
positive,Perfect fit to my Sedona 2009
positive,No more spilt gas when fueling garden tractor.
negative,"I'd be reluctant to keep this in the house as it smells strongly of the cheapest burnt Chinese plastic. It also has the button labels in Chinese which is strange. Having said that, since it's a vacuum you keep in the car, in a case, that isn't such a big deal.<br /><br />It has to be plugged into a cigarette lighter to work (no battery). The suction is OK but not great. It's definitely not heavy duty and is best for picking up some dust and light debris between cleanings with a real vacuum. It does not have a dust bin separate from the filter so be prepared to need to change or attempt to clean the filter a lot.<br /><br />The tire inflation feature works but it's very slow and very weak. It may work in a tight pinch to help you get enough air in the tire to limp to a service station but that's about it. However, in an emergency that may be enough and for the price maybe it's worth it.<br /><br />In short I'd say the major use case is if you just like to vacuum up dust and very small crumbs. It's pretty good for that."
negative,Didn’t fit for my F250. It was not long enough to be able to lock. Ended up getting a different one
positive,I took the number rings off as someone else suggested and lubed everything up good with grease. I always put the rubber boot over the combination lock when it is mounted on the car. No water gets in and it should last forever.
positive,heavy duty
negative,made in China  THERE is a Califorina waring label to not be use for drinking water.  dose qualify for free shipping although it says it dose on the description..
positive,This is used for winch on a low boy trailer. Works as expected. Good quality
positive,Beautiful addition.
positive,Don't forget to disconnect your negative terminal to reset your air flow sensor. I've put this product on my last five Chevy trucks. It's always worth the money.
positive,Noticed better response. Gas mileage about the same. Louder
negative,"Bought this part in August of 2019.  Finally put it on in July of 2020 and thought, wow, this went on easier than all the commenters said it would.  1 day later is what the image shows.  The knocking of the steering column was nice and quiet for the one day.  This alleges to be a doorman part, and it may be, but the Doorman part form the local parts store was mfg in Taiwan while the amazon part was China.  The Taiwan part went on like the bear I was expecting.  Hopefully it lasts longer."
negative,"If you think a strainer holds water well , then you will love this air mattress. Holds air for about 2 hrs . Very thin material for something that is suppose to sit in a truck bed . Wouldn’t recommend."
positive,I received mine today.  I put a smart phone into it and called the phone from another phone.  The phone in this bag did not ring.  I swapped phones and tried it with a second phone.  Same results.  It works.
positive,"I just finished replacing my OEM ignition coils (BOSCH) and plugs (NGK/VW) with these DENSO beauties at the 8 year/60,000 mile mark.  I learned on my Jetta...VW OEM coils have a life cycle.  These fit snugly on top of new NGK Iridium plugs in the VW 2.0L engine.  Being careful, it still took under an hour with a spark plug extension on a cheap ratchet set.  Pop the plastic engine shield, push the coil plug ""rack"" off the coil with a flat head screwdriver, one at a time and pull them up one cylinder at a time, then unscrew your plugs and inspect the tips for oil and corrosion.<br /><br />Change the air filter at the same time and give the onboard computer time to adjust to the cleaner air/spark mix.  Voila...renewed engine!  Any hesitation off the line is gone and the run up the gear box is smooth and linear again.  DENSO invented and perfected the long coil...it's a global economy on Amazon.  I saved about $200 vs. US VW dealer costs.  Now, I start quick, run quiet and my (Mean) City/Hwy mileage went from 27 mpg to 37 mpg on Premium.  At $4.50 a gallon, these coils and Iridium plugs pay for themselves in three to four months of driving."
positive,"Fits great...reduces glare nicely, but does not stick to the dashboard! We don’t know why...something on the dashboard too slick?"
negative,"It is made for area with 3rd row up, so it doesn't cover space with 3rd row down."
positive,"These were easy to install after watching a YouTube video of how to remove the old ones. They replaced the old, broken down original ones perfectly and now water isn’t getting into the door every time it rains. Plus they make the old car look great!"
positive,"The only down side is that you have to loosen the bolts in the headrest to put the covers on them. The seats pop out easy without tools. You just stretch the cover on back first and then bottom. Then snap the seat back in. They come out for easy hosing down. They made my weathered seats look good again. There's a little slack, but they haven't blown off going down the highway at 75 MPH."
positive,Perfect
negative,"Set screws WILL vibrate loose sooner or later. Use BLUE Loctite to secure these. Manufacturer does not take much pride in Q/A, watch out for burrs and sharp edges left over from the factory. Like some said, the offset expander bolt is pretty cheap and doesn't hold very well. I tossed those for some other cylindrical expander bolts I had from other projects. But for the money these work fine. You can spend 3x or more for CRG name brand, but no one but you will know the difference."
positive,Fits on all of our vehicles inside and out.
positive,love it
negative,Ok but I was hoping for handles that were a bit more heavy duty.
positive,Smells like leather!!!!
negative,Lots of dark spots and the plug fits loosely
positive,Top quality tool box but it's weather guard it should be. You get what you pay for when it comes to truck tool boxes and weather guard is the best.
positive,Works great.. Placed it on the windshield of the Harley Davidson Switchback
positive,"Fit and work perfectly.  Wipe well, no streaks."
positive,Love it
positive,genuine Honda parts
positive,These are expensive but there are not many options for a Honda VTX 1300C as the handlebar is different. This is the only style which will work. In the end it makes an amazing difference and transforms the comfort level of the machine allowing the handlebar to come to you instead of you reaching for it. Highly recommend.
positive,I have been using these dusters for years around the house and sometimes the car.  They do a great job and last a very long time.  What more can I say.  They work....
negative,"Its junk, Now why would i say that you might ask?  Sure its a rain cover, but it is extremely light. Light enough that it blew away with very light wind from an SUV. Now by all means if you are looking for something light make sure you get the one tthat fits your vehicle tight or use some sort of ropes so it wont fly away."
positive,"I love bling, so perfect for my new car!  Also, they often call me the queen!"
positive,"This is a great little scanner that takes care of the basic needs. It's easy to navigate and has a nice color screen, and even does some of the graphing of live data. The refresh rate is a bit slow, so the graphs are a little sketchy. But otherwise this is a great unit that is handy to have around the shop or garage."
positive,"After almost knocking myself out on the edge of one slideout, this product is essential to have on our motor home."
positive,Perfect for someone who drives as Indian. My friend loved it.
positive,I have been using them for years good everyday truck tire. Would recommend them.
positive,Sturdy and long enough to get my big Buick windows. Works great but hate to have to use it.
positive,I use this every time when I wash my car and it has really helped to keep my tires clean and looking awesome.
positive,Very bright and visible in even the brightest sunlight. They compare favorably to any LED warning light that I have seen. I recommend them strongly.
positive,"Used this on a my Harley Sportster custom 883, 2006. It didn't fit right out of the box. I had to make a hack to make it fit. But it fits. It takes the wind off my chest at speeds over 50MPH. It looks a bit funny because it sticks out so much. I had to drill and grind 2 small metal pieces to extend for the visors clamps to be able to reach the screw holes of the forks. If you want plug and play- it's not for your 883C but if you don't mind getting a little dirty go for it. Some people like it, some don't, I really like the look, club style."
positive,"I am impressed! This &#34;thing&#34; works exactly as it's supposed to. It took me perhaps 15 minutes to install the exhaust adapter (somewhat unusual situation, so it could take others a lot less time if all was &#34;normal&#34;), which remains in place on the generator's exhaust pipe. All the pieces fit together precisely, so that once the exhaust adapter is installed, it takes maybe 5 minutes to install the whole thing--and it works! It quiets the generator a little, but most important, it diverts the generator exhaust about 10' above the normal exhaust pipe outlet. The recommended test, of seeing if a small piece of paper will travel upwards inside it, worked exactly as predicted--perfectly.<br /><br />Some comments:<br />&#62;The curved steel part that is attached to the exhaust adapter gets really hot. Keep pets and children away! Not sure how, but I'm thinking some sort of protective shield might be a good idea. It stays hot, well after the generator has been shut down, so no one should get anxious to demount the system too quickly. I didn't time it, but I'd guess it was a good 5 minutes before I could leave my fingers on it.<br />&#62; The plastic piping never gets too hot to touch. My first test run was for about 15 minutes with the generator running and the RV's air conditioner loading it. The ambient temperature during the test was about 95 degrees. Yet I could touch the plastic pipe anywhere that I chose to.<br />&#62;I can't imagine making one as inexpensively as this one costs, while still trusting it to do the job. I'm a DIY person, so I priced pipe and pieces some time ago, and if my time is worth more than 25 cents/hour, I couldn't duplicate as good a one for the money."
negative,"Cheap aluminum,  punched out. Rattles in the housing. Box broken during shipping due to being packed in with two heavy items."
positive,Awesome color accent for my jeep.
positive,The missing link! This cleared my CEL on my 97 4runner after replacing the O2 sensors and the TPS.
negative,"Not my first rodeo. Out of the packaging it looks promising. Reality is that it’s sorely lacking. Obviously not leather and that’s ok, but it’s not a good facsimile. It stretches a bit but ends up looking as cheap as it is. Stitching is weak, broke with minimal tension. The included thread is laughably thick. Doesn’t need to be to be strong, but this stuff tangles not matter how careful you are. Have never seen thread work so hard to unravel.<br /><br />You can do better. Easily."
positive,"Didn’t use velcro or sticky tape, stays in place in my 2019 Toyota Tacoma 4-door. A bit of a tight fit, which probably why it doesn’t fall. Used mostly for face masks, so they stay clean and not mixed up with everything else in the truck."
positive,Great value! Very durable and awesome fit!
positive,Item as described
positive,Perfect replacement.
negative,"Due to its high viscosity, it seems to attract more dirt than keep the tires clean over time.  I would much prefer the spray can version.  One trial was enough.  Trashed it at about halfway through."
negative,"Im a contractor by trade. Love my tools...especially good ones. The handle on this is not that big. Im 5ft4inches tall and well my hands aint that big ya know? My hand dwarfs the handle on this tool. I suppose if leverage is not what you need from the handle end of this tool, it should be fine.<br />Otherwise it looks and feels like &#34;made in China cheap&#34;. That being said, its sharp and has an intricate bend to the tip. Looks good for the purpose intended. Think its worth about what I paid for it."
positive,This is my second Park tool patch kit.  Once I realized how dead simple it is to repair flats on my bike I haven't had took buy another tube.  Never had a bad patch with this kit..
positive,For that extra torque some connections need.
positive,I love all towels from them
positive,Basic
positive,Was easy to install and worked well
positive,Good 10w40 oil for wet clutch applications. Keep up with regular maintenance and this oil will do just fine.
positive,"Super easy to install, drop in.  Really nice to have ur small items organized and easy to reach.  Highly recommend getting one."
positive,used to repair engine oil filter line on skidsteer exactfit and did not have to buy fifty feet!
positive,It fits fine and I guess it will work fine.. Just prepare to be underwhelmed by this injection molded piece of plastic.
positive,Really the only one that you can actually feel makes a difference
positive,Works great! Fit on 2006  Nissan Xterra.
positive,"Even though I followed the guidelines for the correct battery, the battery was too small. Once installed and started, the battery started right up. I will see how good it is after not driving my car in this snow storm for two weeks."
positive,Exactly what I wanted...and you get two!
positive,I bought these to replace the cheap ones that came with my JD 1025r. These are much better. They really fit tight and snug. This was a good purchase. Shipping was quick too.
positive,"I tried this in order to carry my air  machine for tire inflation.  I didn't want to store in card box.  This is so nice; better than I expected.  It holds my machine, safely, and the extra parts and has a little space left for other small items. Inside the carrier is a mesh insert bag in top that holds instructions and other papers.  I like the black exterior with the yellow accents to make it stand out.  So little room needed in trunk. I would recommend without receiving compensation."
positive,"I buy these quite often as I get a lot of flats on my roadie due to glass.  The patches are easy to place, and they don't come off once they are glued.  The glue does sometimes stick to my tire, but it pulls from the tires pretty easily."
positive,"Pissed off at GM since I bought a $64,000 truck and this was not included.<br /><br />BUT it is a welcome addition!!"
positive,Fit perfectly
positive,"This shackle has the breaking strength of 38,000 lbs.  This is amazing considering its light weight and softness.  If you need to do an emergency tow and not scratch your vehicle this shackle comes with a nice sleeve for protection.  Its synthetic fibers offer high strength to low weight and flexibility.  All of this make it easy to stow away in the vehicle or in your carry bag for emergencies.  The flexibility allows it to attach to a variety of fittings."
positive,"This sticker is a little smaller than I was expecting, because I didn't figure it out before I ordered it, but I think it's funny.  i'm kind of bossy at work, so helps make my case and give folks a heads up!"
positive,"They come in Ford / Motorcraft packaging. The CPS is black with purple o-ring. I think this is the one considered the best replacement for a faulty CPS on the 7.3L Powerstroke. The picture on the product page looks different (much lighter), likely due to camera lighting. Haven't installed it yet, but if there are any issues, I will certainly update my review.  01/11/2023"
positive,"I love that its not bulky and easy to operate. I had mine for couple years and used it a lot!!! One day grandkid came over in his car and I saw that his tire had low air pressure and ask if he saw that. Of course he didn't see it or have anything in his trunk to help with this or any road hazard. For Christmas gift, I purchased 2 for grandkids to put in their car.<br /><br />My friend saw what I had, he asked me ordered him one.  After it saved him out in the woods, he ordered 3 more for his kids and friend."
negative,"Bought the 62inch shelf for a new Nissan/Chevy City Express. The shelf is advertised as it fits this vehicle. It doesn't!!<br />Had to cut all the shelving down to size and re assemble. If you do this, make sure you cut opposite side of rails so you end up with a left and right. Otherwise you wont be able to use the metal dividers. The other issue I had was they shelving does not sit against the back of the van. So there is around 3 inches behind the shelf that is un usable. In a small van this reduces the width between shelves 6 inches total. Thats a huge waste of space!! Other than the shelves not fitting correctly and the wasted space, they are very well built. The brackets used the fasten them inside the van had to be modified. But they are adequate.The last picture shows the shelf installed after being cut down.  I dont think I would buy these again based on the fact that they dont fit very well. I think the countoured aluminum shelving would have been a better choice for these small vans."
negative,So disappointed that this came used. I was about to use this in the dark and I could still see the dirt and grime trapped in the vacuum. So gross. Will be returning ASAP.
positive,Perfect for our needs!
positive,"I received my Curt Manufacturing hitch cover today and was pleased that it was very fast shipping. I printed and placed a III% decal on the cover for my own personal touch. But when I tried to put it on my hitch, I ran into a problem. The bend on both ends of the actual cover prevented it from sliding all the way in and the holes would not align for my hitch pin. I'll have to enlarge the holes to make it fit. Other than that, it was exactly what I was expecting for a plastic hitch cover."
positive,Nice addition to my bike. I needed a good bottle holder. Sturdy and very easy to install.
positive,Perfect!!!!
positive,Have used the inverter several times now. Works great. It is very quiet. I would recommend this to anyone needing an inverter.
positive,This is OEM!
positive,Good plug at a good price with fast shipping. Nothing more to say!
positive,You want this for emergencies!<br /><br />Everyone should have one of these in the car.  You never know when a light gets left on in your car and ruins your battery.<br /><br />It’s a good idea to keep this to give you a quick boost and get your car running again. This is really good when you need it !
negative,"save time and money buy the dealer ones made my car worse, ar the end of the day lost time and money amazon returned my money but had to pay a mechanic twice"
negative,"Please don't do it.. that's it, that's all"
negative,This is a terrible design....Lucky if you can get it opened without a knife...<br /><br />That alone makes it terrible product as frustration. I still have the one pack as you literally need a knife to open the container.
positive,👍🏻
negative,Did not fit the vehicle it specifically said it would fit in.
positive,we love them
positive,"CarGuys did NOT ask me to write this review.<br /><br />Before I start, I'm an avid car enthusiast.  On the paint care side of things, I have tried just about every product under the sun.  I have my fair share of sealant, waxes and ceramic coatings.<br /><br />The packaging consists of the sealant bottle, one foam applicator pad and a super high quality, plush, seamless, one-sided microfiber towel.<br /><br />This product, by far, is the easiest to apply and buff off.  It goes on extremely easy.  Waited 30 minutes per the directions, and buffed off with the included towel.  I then followed up with the Car Guys Hybrid Wax.<br /><br />The results are simply amazing when considering the amount of effort and time put into the entire operation.<br /><br />I will update after a few months to advise of product longevity.  I do not run my car through an automatic carwash as they are simply terrible for your paint and also the protection that is applied.<br /><br />Great job, Car Guys.  So far this product is a knock out of the park."
positive,My ac is new again
positive,"I was looking for a yellow colored recovery ring for my yellow Rubicon and found this item. It arrived quickly and is a very sturdy piece with a lot of heft to it. The paint protection plastic is actually bright red but once I got some mud on it, it looks like it's not. Overall very happy with this product and would recommend it."
positive,"It was helpful to read the reviews, after seeing many that installed the back ones wrong , I made sure not to make the same mistake. People, read instructions....lol<br /><br />They fit great on my 2015 jeep"
positive,"Didn't believe the online claim that it would custom fit my 2018 Ford Transit 22' van with tall roof, but it fits perfectly.  Offers excellent protection and heat reduction."
positive,Once again I am pleased with this product bought from meguiars !<br /><br />This makes product number 4 that I have bought and they are all great.<br /><br />Makes cleaning my Audi a great pleasure and the finish is showroom quality when I am done !
positive,"Overall an excellent plastic razor blade. My wife uses these for her nail art and they preform well.<br /><br />Now, the changes: Orange blades instead of blue. Not sure if they're different compositions, but they work.<br /><br />No longer Made in the USA, now made in China."
positive,So far so good seems to be working fine.
positive,"This is so easy to use.  I have a 2014 A-Liner, simply remove the drain plugs under the unit, screw this to the water-in connection and connect the compressor hose.  So easy to do that I will not hesitate to camp in the cold weather knowing that I have to do this every time I come home."
positive,This does fit the 2018 sportsman 570. I have it on mine. You just have to adjust the drop leg. My Atv store told me it wouldn't work. It bolts right up. I have used it for two winters now. Its much stronger and better built than the smaller one. With the drop leg it makes it much easier to hook up and unhook.
negative,Good
positive,This is a good heavy strap should not brake for a long time like the cheep one did. Just wish it would come in a 10ft one just as well very nice strap.
positive,Thank you it's perfect
positive,"Last winter was terrible here in N.J., so in preparation, got this blanket for my son's car.  A psychologist, he is part of a mobile crisis operation and often has to journey out in the cold at all different hours.  He says the blanket works faster than his car's remote start to keep his still too skinny legs nice and warm.  Fits nicely in it's storage sack too.  Great buy."
positive,I use this for harley big twin engines and it works well to loosen filter
positive,"30yrs ASE certified mechanic.<br />I bought my 2010 Tundra  used to replace my  2007 Tundra that was totaled out. The 2010 Tundra came with a K&N ""cold"" air cleaner already installed. FYI the K&N is not a true cold air kit because it is not sealed from the engine bay and  it pulls air (hot air) from the engine compartment vs cold air via the fender well like the factory.<br />I included pictures so you can see the quality and design difference between the K&N vs the S&B CAI kit. Filter housing is a true cold air set up for the S&B. Intake tube is much larger for the S&B vs the K&N and well as the air filter.  IMO you can not buy a better CAI kit for a factory motor set up in your vehicle than the S&B kit."
positive,Works
positive,Nice
positive,"The dreaded tire pressure warning light came on. Three gas stations later, I couldn't find one with a working air machine. So...after a ton of research I bought the Black & Decker ASI300 inflator.<br />After checking the pressure in all four tires, I found that one was low 15 PSI, while the others were about 7-8 PSI low. That's what I get for loaning my car to my kid when she was visiting from out of state.<br />ANYWAY, it took me less than 10 minutes to inflate all 4 tires to the correct pressure. You set the dial to the desired tire pressure, connect to the valve stem, turn it on and wait a couple minutes. Machine stops automatically when correct pressure is reached. After I inflated 4 tires, I turned on the ignition and the dreaded light was still on! Then I remembered reading about the spare tire on the back of my SUV causing the warning light to come on. So I topped off the spare which was about 10 PSI low. This time the dreaded warning did not light!<br />As an added bonus, it operates on AC or via the cig lighter outlet in your auto.<br />For the convenience and safety of being able to inflate everything from basketballs to tires at home or on the road, I'm giving this 5 stars."
positive,Fit my Momo race seat and my 2016 Nissan GTR perfectly.
positive,Replaced the cap on 2004 kia Optima.  Fit and worked.
positive,car washing
positive,It really does fir perfectly in my LEXUS.. I would recommend this product
positive,fits well between our sports seat and center console. Useful for holding cell phone or iPad.
negative,"These floor liners are NO WHERE NEAR as good as they used to be. This is my 3rd set purchased in about 10 years. The others were GREAT but these are cheaply made, and don't fit ! For $200 these are HORRIBLE!!!! I WILL NEVER BUY IT RECOMMEND AGAIN."
positive,Perfect fit!
positive,STARRY NITE.  So cute. Easy to attach.
positive,fast shipping excellent price
positive,"Husband ordered the filter for his side by side.  He's happy, it was a repeat order!"
positive,Popped right in...perfect!!
positive,"Had to remove rear tires and drill to install, but worked out very well!"
positive,"I have a 2006 Hyundai Sonata, and the Jumbo car windshield sunshade fits beautifully. I have used the twist-fold circular sunshades previously, so I had no trouble folding it back into a circle for storage. I am so pleased with this product and am glad I purchased it. I have only had the sunshade for 2 days, so I cannot speak to how it will hold up. If anything happens to affect my opinion of the product, I will update my review."
positive,These are Great and look Great on my truck
positive,"This genuine sheepskin car seat cover is beautiful and superb quality. I am actually using it to cover my office chair so I can't comment on the fit for a car, however I have had these covers in the past and this one is made very well. The main areas of the back, seat and front of the headrest are sheepskin (which is foam backed) while all sides, the back of the seat cover and the back of headrest are faux fur (see last photo where the top of the seam is the faux fur and the bottom is genuine sheepskin). The headrest being a separate piece is also a great selling point. The skin is super soft and a somewhat short length with a buttery color. It is very comfortable and I highly recommend it."
positive,"Works flawlessly and for the price I don't know how you can beat it.  Maintenance isn't sexy, but it's necessary."
positive,Work and fit great!
positive,Easy to install and will hold the license plate securely. Did not need the new screws and caps and I used the old ones.
positive,"My mechanic told me my car's wheel bearing needed to be replaced. And so I went into Amazon and looked for one that fit my car but also had great reviews. That ended with this one. When I brought it to my mechanic, he told me Timken was a good brand. Great!"
positive,Quality product.  Correct sizes for my  2003 Saturn Vue.
positive,It's a cycle battery... it's as I expected. We'll see how long it lasts. Easy to perform the initial electrolyte fill up. So far so good!
positive,Parts looked just like the description.
positive,Hey for the price you can’t beat it. Especially if it’s to get you by.
negative,"This is the real thing ,you might want to remove the part because it’s hard to get of<br />UPDATE IT LOOKS TERRIBLE WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE ON!"
positive,So far this is the best trickler I have found
positive,"Bought this filter for my Town & Country, and it was a perfect fit. These Fram filters are solid - you aren't going to have any dust or dirt get in the air intake. So it does the job!"
positive,"Difficult to accurately state this product worked as I wanted (uneven idle), for it was preceded by another product--however, the idle improved so I rate this as excellent."
positive,"Added this to my Milwaukee M12 inflator... ""Super mod"""
positive,Fit perfectly
positive,Good match. It's difficult to get the paint smooth so it blends in but I found a little polishing compound helps blend the area where the old and new paint meet. I may try some of the clear coat to see it that helps even more.
positive,My mechanic had this installed in 5 minutes and no problems with oil leaking since...I still hate this Saab though. Grrrrr
positive,"Good Item, Fast Shipping"
positive,"Functionally, it does its job (fills tires).  However, the filler tube is way too short (I bought an extension).  The 12V and 120V cables are poorly stored. On the positive side, it runs very cool."
positive,Look great fit fine
positive,Good product!👍
positive,good replacement for trailer lights
positive,"These just barely work in the windshield of our 2012 Volt, but they DO work, if you put the visors down to hold them up.  I use them sideways because the windshield is more deep than wide.  I put the elastic loop attached to one of these over one visor, which holds it up more securely, then the other one leans against the first, which also helps to hold them up.  If BOTH of them had an elastic loop to put over the visor, that would be great in my humble opinion.  When you twist them together to fold up, they do their wiggly best to &#34;escape&#34; out again, so I just fold as well as I can in a few moments, wrap the elastic loop over the lot, and toss into the back seat.  They do the job, which is the important thing."
positive,Works
negative,Software did not work... no idea if the cable does
positive,"I have a brand new convertible top on my car, so I used this on it since it said Lint free, it left lint on my black top.  It’s very hard to get lint off it once it gets on it, even with a brush. But I have yet to find a mitt that doesn’t leave lint.  The mitt fits snuggly on my wrists, and they are small, so that was good, but water somehow still got into the mitt, which I don’t care about.  So it functioned as a regular mitt, nothing special for me."
positive,Very easy to install and look’s great.
positive,"Work well, the inside of boot can get torn..."
positive,These are clever window clings that block glare in car windows. They work great for that! If only they were easier to fold back up!
positive,"Worked perfectly, will never go back to the aftermarket wipers after using these. Took around 5 minutes to install and they work great."
negative,Terrible adhesion to the door- I feel it slip every time I pull the door closed. Not great quality- can definitely tell they’re aftermarket. I think you get what you pay for but the product leaves a lot to be desired.
positive,"This scrapper is really nice and arrived really quickly. It came disassembled, but only took me a moment or two to put together. It's strong and has done an excellent job so far. I live in Northern Wisconsin, and we have snow October - May! A good snow scrapper is essential and I am happy to have found this one. I buy from this company again, so I would have to recommend it.<br />Hope this review was helpful."
negative,Broken when they arrived.
negative,Yeah it does the job<br />Ends look like something i can machine better<br />Locking device for better words jenky
positive,Durable
positive,Clock looks great on the dash of my 1985 Corvette.  Only issue I have with it is that it doesn't have an internal light so it can be viewed during the night.
positive,Nice sticker
positive,Works perfectly
positive,Great product
positive,I needed this for a garden trailer.  Good Finnish nice quality.
positive,Easy to use and install.  Secures spare like advertised.  Definitely recommend this product.
positive,good people
positive,This is very sturdy and I trust it to keep my phone safe as it holds it in snugly. Only complaint is that when biking and hitting bumps it doesn't always stay in the position I want it to. It's difficult to tighten that knob enough to keep it from moving.
positive,Easy to install and fit my little 1.8T golf.  Supported a rack and two mountain bikes without any issues.
positive,Great product
positive,Easy to install
positive,Great product. It fit well and was easy to apply. It protects my paint from stone chips. My only change would be that I wish it didn't have a logo on the far right.
positive,"Decent mirrors.  They fit well after a bit of rotation to align them correctly.  I have experienced some vibration, but not excessive.  Decent product for a good price."
negative,Not US made so doesn’t really work properly with modified
positive,"Much prettier in person and very comfortable (sort of cushiony).  Since it is winter time, I find that I have a nice grip on the steering wheel while wearing gloves.  The only con is: it is a monster trying to get this to fit around the steering wheel.  I managed to do it but it would probably go faster if you had someone help."
positive,Good deal
positive,"The passenger seat in our car is slanted way down in the rear and there are no controls to move it up or down. I was really uncomfortable every time I was riding shotgun. This cushion is great. Really comfortable, and a much better price than some of the other ones I found. Highly recommend!"
positive,"This is the perfect gag gift for &#34;Walking Dead&#34; fans. So funny! And if you ever got tired of those little stick families, here's your revenge!!!"
positive,These are not a want as much as a need. They cushion your elbow when driving anyone with bone spur can appreciate this. Put on on my car and wife liked it so put one on hers. She l9ves it
negative,"It looks super functional, however, it did not fit my car visor. I was planning to use this for a long cross country road trip but it was too large (mostly the length) and looked awkward on my Toyota Camry."
positive,"Why these do not come stock on Ram trucks, I do not understand.  This completely eliminated the death wobble in my Ram 2500.  No bounce or wobble when hitting pot holes, riding on rough roads or going over bridge transitions.  This was easy enough to install, it only required two people when measuring the right spot to add the Bilstein mounting bracket; otherwise, it was easy to do.  For under $250 this should be already installed on large trucks, but since they’re not, this should be everyone’s first add-on.  Buy it, you won’t be disappointed."
positive,As promised
positive,"[[VIDEOID:69a190abb4a14e6a02bec0845477be97]] This trunk organizer is working out great for me as a tool/carry-all. It was easy to put together, has good sized compartments and plenty of pockets to put things in.<br />I've buckled one side to the other side's end, and made it half its size. This one side has three compartments in it, so that I can carry all of my tools about my home easily. There's a nice shoulder strap, so that if I am walking up and down the stairs, if I would like, I can use it to carry it that way.<br />The bag, compartments, pockets and straps are all made of highly durable material, that will last a very long time.<br />The bottom sits flat, and the whole organizer has enough weight to it, that if used in a trunk, it will not tip over, or fly about.<br />For myself, this has been the best way that I have found to organize my tools in a way that I can easily see, carry and get to them. I love that! I highly recommend this organizer, whether it's for tools, or for the trunk."
positive,"These are so inexpensive compared to others, you could replace these 2-3 times as often and still come out ahead. They were the easiest wipers I've ever installed although the photo in the instructions was backwards. I have had these on one car for over 6 months now and still working perfectly, just installed them on my other vehicle."
positive,"We use this for all our electronics that have been exposed to sea air and sea water. They have salvaged several connection sites for our GPS units, etc."
positive,cool little accents for you car knobs. Some may fit tighter than others. I dont know what it will look when when you want to take them off. may need some extra loving when you clean u the original knobs due to the adhesive strips used for them.
positive,exactly what I was looking for.
negative,"I will say I was able to use this product to so the job I needed it for...BUT, one of the pieces bent in the process & because it was an important piece & it's a small kit, it took a while lot of agination to finish the job. Not happy with the low quality of this tool tool"
positive,Ordered the wrong type. Had to return it.
positive,Absolutely perfect. Fits exactly all the way up to door sills. The bottom has &#34;cleats&#34; to keep it in place. Please note you should be careful installing these with leather interior the cleats are pretty pointy!
positive,nice
negative,Want keep running
negative,This says it fits my new explorer and it's a lie. I end up returning it.
negative,They are 1/2 short of fitting properly!!!
positive,"Superb!  What else can you say?  This light bar is HUGE!  And very BRIGHT!  It is second to none.  I have purchased tons of light bars and have had good and not so good.  This one is neither, it is AWESOME!  You've heard of turning night into day, this thing does just that.  I'm glad I'm behind it instead of looking at it, it's blinding.  I can't honestly remember purchasing an item of this quality at such a low price and being this pleased with it.  As with most lights, it comes mounting brackets and a section of wiring, it's a good idea to install a high grade switch for this monster.  Will definitely not disappoint.  Want another one ASAP.  I received this item at a discounted rate for an honest review."
positive,Perfect for storing lug nuts
positive,Great to have for car for all electrical connections. Can run off car battery and just an extra precaution in today's chaotic world..
positive,Great fit and worked great on the PW50.
positive,I ordered these for my 2011 JKU.  Fit perfect and hold my a-pillar lights just fine.  These have been mounted for at least a year now and the finish still looks fine.  I don't expect any issues.
positive,"Perfect for my 08 avalanche, easy to install."
positive,Brighter than my stock cargo lamp for sure but certainly doesn't flood the place. I'll take the tradeoff on luminosity for the low energy consumption though
positive,My tires are 295/60/20. Purchased the 32”-34” set and they went over the wheel easily.  I just bought these four neto tires and they weren’t cheap. My truck sets outside so I wanted these to protect the tires from the UV light.  I did this for my last set a tires and they lasted me eight years.
positive,I've definitely noticed more power from my engine after using this product.
positive,"great quality in a document holder, now all your car's important paperwork is held and displayed neatly."
positive,"Seen several Used Oil Analysis of the edge synthetic with very good results. The 0w-40 sure keeps my 1999 Camry with near 300,000 miles quiet on cold starts compared to 5w-30. Haven’t noticed oil use in any of my 3 vehicles going to this over pennzoil platinum"
positive,Very good product.
negative,"The seams of the cover are coming apart. I put this cover on my 1957 Chevy Bel Air 3 months ago and now I will need to get another cover. I tried to contact the seller for a return, but I got no response."
positive,Is as stated
positive,A++++++
positive,Great thing thank you
positive,Worked fine on my 4 cylinder Grand Am.
positive,Does what it says. Gives a fast and accurate tire pressure reading. Easy to use.
positive,I can’t beleive how much this simple tire change made my 800 lb Road King handle like it was a 125 dirt bike...  I almost thought my camber was off because the bike was so nimble!  Had my buddy try it to confirm.
positive,"This is a must have if you have any sort of modern car. I've used it quite a bit and it's a powerful troubleshooting tool. I mean, how great is it that instead of a tedious process to figure out why your hoopty is running rough to have the computer tell you &#34;Cylinder 5 misfire&#34;. That narrows it down quite a bit and saves tons of time. Going to AutoZone will get you the error code, and maybe some advice. This will tell you what's wrong."
positive,My husband loves it.  Works better then others he's used.
negative,Doesn’t fit 2018
positive,Easily removed adhesive left from removing vinyl paint protector
negative,"It does fit, it seems a hair larger than the OEM air filter, but at this time... so far so good."
positive,The original seat on our JD LX277 started coming unglued from its frame.  This one is just as comfortable and seems to be perfect.
positive,Works good for my light bar. no drilling
negative,"This is a solid product with one missing item that would make it great. It is secured via straps in the front and in the rear of the car but leaves the middle exposed. There are tabs present that you can use to jury rig your own method of securing the center so it seems someone thought it would be a good idea. Not sure why they didn’t just add a simple strap to the cover. Without the center strap the cover tends to balloon and not feel very secure in high winds. I solved the problem by attaching some bungee cords to the straps but again, the lack of a manufacturer provided strap seems like an oversight. Otherwise no issues with the product during the short amount of time I have owned it."
positive,Cute
negative,"Only wanted one to light up my license plate but figured why not for the price. One light BARELY puts out enough light to light up the middle of my plate, and throws some light on the sides of the plate. So they're not very bright. Pattern is more on the wide side, like maybe 60 degrees or so."
positive,"When I see the word &#34;kit&#34; I &#34;assume&#34; it is a KIT, not just the bearing.<br />So this product was just the bearing, nothing else ... the write-up description talks of triple seals but you'll need to get seals somewhere else.<br />They must be referring to internal seals or something.<br />Or... just blame me the buyer ... I should have known ... somehow.<br /><br />WHOOPS!!!! My bad ... the seals that came off the original appear to have been &#34;part&#34; of the old bearing itself, and the Yamaha diagram doesn't show individual seals so I have to assume there are no separate seals required.  The bearing came quickly and was a great price."
positive,Works good if you know what your doing
positive,Fits snuggly between the seats and is well made.
positive,"This is a custom fit. However, I'd like it to be a bit taller, as the sun visor just barely catches the top of the shade. Pretty good all around though. If it were a bit taller, it'd be a 5 star"
positive,These fit well and work great and make your truck look fantastic.  Only issue is the mounting brackets are kind of cheapy plastic. I used the ones from my orignal headlights and they work great.  I read this tip in another review and will pass it along because it works.  Be sure to shine your lights on a wall and mark where they shine with tape.  This will help you to level the new lights to make sure they are hitting at the right level.
positive,Good stock replacement gear set
positive,Awesome product
positive,Excellent
positive,Works as designed and well made.
positive,Hard for me to fold.
positive,"Just like the factory part, car looks like new."
positive,Nice quality very bright and good beam pattern
positive,"Good stuff, does what its suppose to."
positive,Received as listed...
positive,Don’t even hesitate. This thing is AMAZING
positive,Great quality product. The sponges are high quality and 2 come with the set. I'm looking forward to giving my saddle a good cleaning
positive,I like that I have everything I might need at my finger tips instead of reaching over to cover box
positive,Fits OK and doesn't rattle around.
positive,works great and smells wonderful
positive,"I may update later with a less glowing review, after having some time on these.<br /><br />But for now... I just installed these on a 2009 E92 M3 Coupe. The halogens right side went out, and so I bought a pair of these to replace, having read TONS of reviews that said the LED stuff just would not be bright enough in the daytime, because the new BMW's LED halo eyes had different light tunnelling technology, and my halo light tunnels were more suited for the halogen wavelengths or brightness pattern.<br /><br />So instead of stock halogen, being disappointed that I could not achieve modern BMW white brightness ala LED, I got the PIAA extreme yellow.<br /><br />Install was quick. Watched a couple youtube videos (best tip was make sure the lights are TURNED OFF before starting, no need to disconnect battery) on how to replace the lamps and I was done in 20 min from start to finish and I have big hands and those light compartments are SMALL!<br /><br />Upon powerup, the lights were a deep orange... very close in color to the parking lights. I was like huh... thought they would be more yellow, but fine, orange is quite cool too , my paint is jet black.<br />After about 5 min, the color had turned to a bright yellow... so maybe the bulbs had to burn in a bit. The yellow is quite bright and deep in it's yellow-ness, and I was quite pleased at the contrast between that yellow and the bi-xenon headlight projectors. It looks really cool imho, a nice contrast. Much better than the halogen pale yellow.<br /><br />Tried to take a pic but the brightness is so high that it comes out as pure white in the picture... only our human eyes have that much dynamic range.<br /><br />Very highly recommended for the factory halogen angel eyes, preLED. I hope they last long as other reviews said these would burn out quick.<br /><br />I will post if that happens, meanwhile, these are quite pleasing to the eye, and much cheaper than H8 LED  lamps.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />p.s. both driver and passenger bulbs do turn clockwise to remove, and counter clockwise to install. The driver side is easier on the M3 due to the fact that the bulb starts at 1100 and you turn to 0300 ... the passenger starts at 0100 and turns to like 0400... bit harder but totally doable. Just get your hands in there and be careful.<br /><br />I used a rubber glove to hold the new bulb so as not to get finger grease and ruin the glass."
positive,Good product
positive,requires patience and a steady hand (and eye coordination) to access the battery for replacing the battery
positive,It was an exact OE fit with a very reasonable price.
positive,"Fit perfect. I just have to say something...I put this in my truck in about twenty minutes, and I'm handy, but not a mechanic. When I bought my truck, the dealer said it was going to be a huge bill to replace this part between the part and labor. Bull**it. GO AMAZON and a little help from youtube. I don't want to ever go to a dealer or garage again. Once again, props to Amazon. Amazon is the best thing ever! If you ever want an advertiser let me know LOL!"
negative,The description was spot on and based on the dimensions given I determined that it would fit my 2000 Explorer despite the various statements to the contray. It fits perfectly and looks like it came from the factory. It is a good design and I would have given a higher rating except the foam is overly soft and the vinyl seems pretty thin and I have concerns about how long it will last.
positive,This is a STANDARD Toyota air filter.  It will work on basically any Toyota.  I used this on a 2008 Lexus LS.<br /><br />Save yourself $40-$80 at the dealer and install this on your own.
positive,Excellant part quality and price
positive,as expected
positive,works well
positive,"Fit my 07 Tundra great. Hooked up a 5x8 U-haul trailer, and no problems at all. Not sure how it will do with something heavier, but I suspect it will work great up to it's rating"
positive,I now have three of these; I wouldn't use another brand.  Very reliable.  Plus it comes with essential cables/connectors.
negative,Did not work on my car. I wish they would’ve explain a little more about it before a.m..
positive,It's a spark plug.
positive,This tool is one of my favorites. My family can even use it easily. Worth it definitely. Would purchase it again.
positive,gets the job done
negative,Good
positive,It looks great on my red car!
positive,Used this to hold water bottle on John Deere riding lawn mower. Works great.
positive,This cover is actually better than I thought. Those grey fabric style ones are like paper towels that shread very easily. This one is also thin but I think it is going to hold up a lot longer. It looks good too.
positive,After a couple rains holds nicely. Just have to wait for a winter and see how it goes.
positive,"I routinely travel east-west from inland to Daytona and Ormond beaches almost daily, so when I was offered one of these as a review sample I jumped on the opportunity. There seems to be a love it or hate it attitude, so I will explain why I love it, what I do not like about it and you decide.<br /><br />What I do like first: it's not the best designed solution. The clip is a little difficult to initially slide over my visor. Also, the 'visors' are a little stiff, and the operational requirements are not exactly user friendly. Finally, these are more filter than visor, and in that role they work, but are really plastic sheets.<br /><br />Why I gave it five stars anyway. I travel towards the rising sun going to my destination and into the setting sun when going home - this is almost daily. Some days I am not directly affected depending on weather, exact time of day and even time of year. Other days the sun is directly in my eyes and frankly the trips are unsafe. This product cuts down on the direct glare and makes my trips on most days infinitely safer. For that reason alone I love this - warts and all.<br /><br />While the sun visor (or filter, actually) works, I have not found the night visor to be that effective, I usually do not have problems with night driving so only tried it a few times and decided that I did not need it. If you are purchasing this primarily for night driving factor my comments in, but also know that I did not have a problem to begin with for that type of driving.<br /><br />Still undecided? Since there are reviews rating this from 1 to 5 stars in almost equal numbers, read a sampling of those. Many make valid points for and against, so you can decide if this is the product for you. It is for me, but not for everyone."
positive,Wix air filter compatible with 4th Generation 4runner V6 not sure about V8. Save some money buying online. I recommend this product...great buy.
positive,Great vent shades. Easy to use
positive,Great fitting LEDs that offered a complete kit to easily change out the interior bulbs with the included pry tool.<br /><br />I bought this pack because a bulb burnt out and it wasn't much more to replace them all and just switch to LED. I feel like these are brighter than the factory bulbs.
positive,Easy to install.  Was a direct fit for my 15 Chevy Silverado.  Just make sure you know how to remove your factory tow hooks before installing...
negative,"Ripped when found outf from my brother in law,. Gave it adbagiftband it stunk"
positive,"I purchased their tire dressing kit that contained a small bottle of tire dressing. I was amazed at the longevity of the product. We had 2 heavy rain storms that i was caught driving in. So i took the car to the car wash, after washing the tires, the shine was still there. This allows the product to last longer."
positive,it looks like it will work fine once I get it installed. Nice quality leather.
positive,This is an easy to use and accurate tire pressure gauge. Highly recommended.
negative,Left hard to remove stains and dulled the gel coat. Had to buff everywhere I used it.
positive,"Wish the cans were bigger, but it does what it's supposed to do."
positive,"Appears to be a good high pressure tire gauge.  It didn't work with the battery compartment door shut to begin with...  inserted thick paper between the top battery and the plastic to keep the battery in place, then it worked well.  Thank you."
positive,Good
positive,So happy this product is made to make us very feminine drivers happy.
positive,"After I spilled an entire large coffee under my passenger seat during a heat wave this summer, my car smelled horrible. I tried to clean under the seat but because it was hard to reach, there was only so much I could do after stuffing towels under there to soak up the coffee. After installing one of these on an air vent in the center of the car, the coffee smell faded very quickly & was replaced with the pleasant clean linen scent. I have often found that car air fresheners are too overpowering, but this is not at all. It seems to be lasting a long time too; I have had it in my car for almost 3 months & it still produces a strong, pleasant scent (especially when A/C is running)."
negative,"Well at first glance they look pretty good. After that, its all downhill. Easy enough to put on, but loose fitting for my seats (smart 2012). Very sleezy fabric and slides around easily. No holes for the safety belt mounts, so you have to manually cut a slit in the fabric. REally, just not good at all. I'll keep them until I can get better ones. Soon, I hope."
negative,"Did not fit a 3"" tongue as described and seemed cheaply made and flimsy. Ended up sending back for a refund."
positive,"I have tried many ways & tricks to park in my garage so that 1. the garage door closes without clipping my front grill/bumper, and 2. allows me to raise and lower my SUV tailgate to get items out and 3. not interfere with my homes inside back door (which opens into the garage). Bought this pair of parking aids and they work perfect. Have a hefty SUV and these blocks are weighty enough to stay in place not being glued or screwed into the concrete floor! Love the precision parking! Thanks. Sold my 2nd car or would order a 2nd set!"
positive,Very High quality and accurate tire pressure gauge I checked the accuracy of this gauge with another high quality tire pressure gauge and It was pound For pound right on the money.
positive,Like a phone case for your license plate.  Plate won’t scratch your car anymore and looks very nice.
positive,I bought this for my husband for Father's day gift and he loved it!! he was very happy..it was very easy to install too!!!! and it is metal and not plastic..you won't regret buying this.. it's worth the price!! and delivery was fast too even though it said July..we got it way earlier than the estimated date..I highly recommend this. we have it on 2019 toyota tacome sr5..
positive,Very nice product.
negative,I don't know about the quality but they didn't work for me
positive,I just finished my Jeep Wrangler. Easy to work with and  does a nice job of quieting the interior. Go for it.
positive,This was a perfect replacement for my older warped yellowed vent cover. Fits perfect and looks so much better.
positive,"I have used these bumpers before and they help keep your back bumper from being cosmetically ugly and scared up. However, the adhesive stickers do not adhere after a couple of washings. They need to formulate a water proof adhesive to be durable and long acting."
positive,Just used it finally in camping trip and item worked like a charm. It does exactly what it says. It keeps the water filter from putting strain on the outside plug on my travel trailer. Definitely recommended to keep the water connection from being damaged.
positive,Received it in a very timely manner.  Product was exactly as stated.  It was easily installed.  I will definitely order from them again.
negative,ok
positive,"I got a rental car once that was smoked in and you could really smell it. I ordered this stuff because I was stuck with the car until mine was fixed. It shipped fast and it worked. The stink was gone. You just make sure windows are closed. Then pop off the top. Press the top lever all the way down while pointing it away from yourself. Set it in your cup holder at an angle and pop out shutting the door behind you. Go back three hours later and viola, smell is gone. This would probably also be a good product to carry if you travel staying in hotel rooms too. I have been stuck in a hotel room where the room had been smoked in and this would probably work for that too."
positive,I can only rate ease of use right now. Jury out on longevity and durability.<br />Applied it to my new Toyota Tacoma and have received several complements on shine and<br />smoothness of the paint.
positive,"Was very easy to install, but I have doubts with only two little screws holding it onto the mount.  The hoses appear top notch, but could have better fittings-they are only plastic.  There may be better and cheaper out there, but this should do the job."
positive,Fit well and work well on the windshield!
positive,Yeah these are the ones you want.  Factory Tahoe ones failed and were too hard to remove.  Just take the lights and grill off and mount to the radiator support.  Extend the wiring and your done.  Did not need the relay as the horns do not exceed the factory amp draw.
positive,Same as when I first bought my car
positive,Fit well and come with extras. Just a little somthing to match the paint and add a little personal touch.
positive,Dear seller.<br />This aftermarket clutch came with a bracket that i do not know how to utilize. Can you provide instructions on how this bracket holds the clutch in place?<br />Dear Amazon buyer.<br />We do not offer installation instructions. If you are not sure how to install please then return we will take it back.<br />--------------How Nice-------------<br /><br />The clutch is a critical part that needs to mechanically installed correctly or it will fail. I found no examples on line to show where this bracket goes but I did read enough about PTO clutch design and operation to know this.<br /><br />You needa pal to help you get through the cursing during removal.<br /><br />Use lock tight on the bracket and the clutch bolt.  If the bracket were to come loose it would destroy the clutch.<br /><br />Spacers should only touch the center raceway or you risk crushing the clutch.<br /><br />Use enough spacers so the new bolt protrudes the same amount as the old clutch and bolt did.<br /><br />Torque the clutch blot! 7/16 -1/2 - 5/8 The size determines the setting.  (Mine was 55 ft lbs)<br /><br />Clean shaft after removal with fine sandpaper. Lube with wd40<br /><br />Install anti sway bracket onto clutch before installing (if it is like mine) use lock tite. It is difficult to reach once in place.<br /><br />Zip tie wire harness so it does not get caught on anything you my run over.<br /><br />Burnish!<br />1/2 throttle<br />Engage PTO for 10 seconds<br />Wait for blades to stop<br />Repeat 10 times<br />Check torque again.<br /><br />Happy mowing
positive,Great product at a great price with prompt processing and shipping.
positive,Works as intended and no installation problems
positive,"I keep 6 or 7  plastic 6 gallon fuel cans around that I fill once or twice a year to fuel ATV, garden tractor, and farm tractor. The plastic fill spouts regularly leak and break and I have regularly spilled gallons of fuel yearly. I have only had it long enough to pump about 10 gallons but I wish I had purchased one years ago. Luv it, and no more spills."
positive,It helped me to detect a thermostat failure on my Mercedes Benz C300 saving me thousands of dollars in engine repairs.
positive,Works great!
positive,love these they are brighter than expected
positive,"This frame fit a 2009 Toyota Camry perfectly.  Do NOT buy the hardware listed on amazon!!! The longest bolt/screw included in the kit is 7/8”, but you will need at least a 1.5” for installing/mounting the bottom of the frame to the car."
negative,"Shackle pads fit well, but the pin washers are way too thin. Need to be at least twice as thick."
positive,easy fit
negative,doesn't fit like it should. This is a classic regular cab stepside with undre 2000 miles and i wanted a good fit and it isn't close...<br />Gerg
positive,"This shirt fits my son very well.  It's pretty cheap and you can tell that by how thin the fabric is.  If it was just a little thicker, it would be worth 5 stars."
positive,This filter fit perfectly in my vehicle based on the amazon garage recommendation. These filters are just as high quality as the OEM and a fraction of the price. Do not pay a mechanic or dealer to change these they are so quick and easy to remove and replace. Most are just behind the glove box and are exchanged with the removal of two latches and a cover.
positive,"Been looking for these for a wile, and have always like ARB products. this works just as good as everything else they make. This product works great."
positive,Nice headlights.  Very bright and give nice coverage.  I highly recommend it.
positive,Installed 2 of these in my honda element for both fronts. They went in well. The hardest part was getting the old ones out as they needed some serious heat as well as a Huge Hammer!
positive,Love these worth the price
positive,"These seem to be pretty much the standard applicator pads these days, but I found they like to dry out and fall apart over time. Once quick tip: If you want to get at few uses out of these, make sure to squeeze out any extra wax, and then seal them up tightly in a ziploc baggie."
positive,Does the job as expected.  Had a question for the tech support and had a bit of a problem getting ahold of him.  When I did he was knowledgeable and friendly.  Answered my question and talked me through changing the set up screen for a trailer and spare tire.
positive,"I love having these in the glove box. You always have your proof of insurance and registration at your finger tips. If you have ever been pulled over and frantically have to sift through all the ""stuff"" in the glove box you know what a life saver this can be. Highly recommend one for every vehicle especially if you have a newer driver in your house; one less worry."
positive,works great
negative,"I marked this low because it is to expensive.  Yes it is made in the usa, but that does not mean I should pay 3 times what it is worth.  The case is nice and it comes with 3 cups and holders that you will never ever use.  The smallest cup is twice the size of the u joint on any car.  I may try to send this back since the only thing that is usable is the c-clamp with a hole in the end.  Someone that does ball joint work may different in opinion but if all you do is ujoints just by a clamp from HF."
positive,"Purchased these for my new Ford Flex.  They fit in perfectly in literally two minutes.  These are durable and easy to clean.  When someone gets grass, dirt in the car they easily vacuum up.  I have not had to remove them yet for winter cleaning, but the fit is very easy and I suspect I will not have any problem getting them out to rinse off.  I have recommended these to other people now that I am a believer.  Very happy with purchase."
positive,cute and easy to install
positive,"I only used it once so far,  It  seems like it is a very good quality tire inflator. It appears to be  well built and very accurate."
positive,"Update 11/6/2017: I must've gotten a defective unit. The seller here on Amazon reached out to me and sent me out a new one under warranty. It took a few weeks to actually get my hands on a new one, but overall satisfied, will update my review in 1 year<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Currently wont power up, was working ok for about a month, then of course right outside the exchange window now wont turn on. $500 brick and Autel wont pick up the phone...<br /><br />screen pops up battery dead, goes away, only thing that lights up is the red power light at the top right once the power button is pushed in.<br />Tried plugging it into multiple cars, it shows a green car icon, but still doesn't power up. Aggravated at this point<br /><br />Update: Contacted Autel through support chat, they told me this version is NOT sold in the US, and that only China supports it. So don't bother trying to get support through Autel in the USA."
positive,Great product
positive,"Since they made this non flammable and tire sensor safe it doesn't seal as good as it used to, but still a good product.  Shake it up real good, pull out the nail or metal sticking in the tire first if there is one.  This won't seal a tire well if you leave the nail in there.  I carry two cans per car because I had a hose assembly break. Or,  keep the nozzle hose assembly off the top of the can for a spare.  This will seal some bead leaks, but not with the wheel mounted on the car.  Take the wheel off. lay it flat with the leaking bead side down, and slowly lift and lower the tire to get the stuff to the bead rim contact area.  Good for galvanized trailer tires which always seem to leak there."
positive,Exactly as described. Bought it as a gift for my son for marching laynard seems like good quality too. Shipped actually earlier than promised too.
positive,I read several reviews of the knobs being plastic when they arrived but I figured I'd take a chance anyway and if it was plastic I'd send it back. Fortunately mine came with a metal knob. I used heavy duty grey ptfe tape and installed. I went to fill the tank to check for leaks and to my dismay the blow off purge valve went off around 115 psi. Thus the reason for 4 stars. Fortunately for me not being able to fill to the full 125 psi is not a big deal but if it is for you then you may want to check into another valve. I am go to let it sit for 24 to 48 hours and check for leak down and will update review.
negative,"I bought this for a 1986 Ford Ranger and I bought the extension cable also. I used it two times and the codes it gave were decent hints to help trouble shoot my engines. It was over a year before I needed to try it again but it didn't seem to be working.<br /><br /> I had also bought the same brand of code reader that only gives you the blinking LED where you need to count the flashes accompanied by a tone, and this &#34;blinking&#34; item still works!, even though it is not very convenient.<br /><br />Now I have done extensive work on my 86 Ford engine, and it is running fine, so I should try it again just to see IF it works?<br /><br />It is not under warranty, but I would like to know if they have a repair policy? It seems to be a neat item, IF it would work?"
positive,So far so good. Didn't take to long to figure out how to put on. Holding up well.
positive,Used for a dome light in my frontier. Those trucks have a deep dome so you cant use festoons that flare out wider than the size of the bulb. These help be get more leds through the use of a led panel and still able to connect to a festoon setup. Was brighter than what I could've get using anything else. Mounts with double sided tape but I just rested the panel on the cover and attached it slowly. Careful thin wires just dont force it and it'll be ok
positive,"Truck manual recommends oil changes every 15,000 miles with regular diesel oil.  The truck takes 12 quarts with filter change.  I feel this is too long for regular oil so decided to go with fully synthetic and the only place to get 15-40 was at Amazon on line.  Now I will go the full 15000 miles."
negative,The Mount broke after the second day of rides g. It literally just snapped right off. ;ow quality bright tho. But cheap cheap mounts
positive,Minimal brake dust!
negative,Didn’t fit
positive,"Over priced for 2 little stickers, but I had a purpose in mind for them. Exactly what you would expect. Kinda cute!"
negative,Wife bought me the 3 pedal Razo for Christmas which I loved. I later saw this dead pedal version to complement. I made the mistake of not measuring and it wasn’t as long as the existing plastic dead pedal. Neither replacing the existing (elevated/protruding) or screwing on this shorter one wasn’t an appealing idea for me.<br />This was just my opinion and might not bother others.
positive,I like this snow brush! I wish it was longer but it does a great job!
positive,Buen producto
positive,Bought for grandson as his broke. Took him all of 5 minutes to program it and it works perfectly!
negative,Installed the lights and one didn't work. Not as bright as the ones I got from superbrightleds for about the same price.
positive,"Great new technology! Brake controllers are normally not installed on my type of vehicle, but my trailer had brakes and for added safety, I wanted to use them. Curt’s wireless adapter made it possible and works extremely well using the factory settings! Thanks Curt!"
positive,"These filters fit my 2008 LGT and 2017 STI.  Have been buying them for 13 years. The model numbers have been appended a few times, but they are the same filters.  Do your research, do not rely on Amazon Auto to tell you what fits your car. This is true for lighting, air, cabin and oil filters.  Buying in quantities of 6 or more with crush washers is the most cost effective way to purchase.  They are made for Subaru by Honeywell."
positive,Adds a touch to our beautiful car.
positive,Very good at cleaning my WeatherTech mats.  Nice protection and low sheen.
positive,TY
negative,"Returned, did not work well."
positive,Flawless.
positive,"This stuff is okay, is thin...<br />have to double or triple layer to get some coverage like the old similar stuff I  have."
positive,easy and nice to install
positive,"I used to get a much more expensive version of this from Brookstone every couple years, when my old one would break or I'd lose it. This one was about half the price but I trusted the reviews, and was not disappointed. It has lasted quite a while so far, and works brilliantly. I imagine I will end up buying a few of these for gifts next winter. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
positive,Works great!!
positive,"My parents had the large, heavy duty coolers for camping trips but nothing like this!  For tailgating, for camping or a long road trip, this is a great portable fridge/freezer.  It can hold a great deal, but then, for me, I put it in the car before filling it up as I would have trouble lifting it full into the car.  I did put the handles on, but even with handles, it can get heavy (for me) to lift when full.  I like the touch screen - puts everything needed to maintain this mini-fridge within easy reach.  A bit on the pricey side, but well worth it when a nice cold drink is needed on a hot summer day at the campground!"
positive,Very easy to install and sounds great
positive,"Love these wipers---clean smooth swipe, no noise. We'll see how long they last! So far so good!"
positive,Seems to be a lot better than what the polisher came with originally.
positive,Haven't installed yet but don't see why wouldn't work.
positive,Fits 2001 Ford Explorer.
negative,Title says it all.  The white lettering smeared after just a few months.
positive,"What’s not to like, it’s a grab hook!"
positive,Excellent product sturdy easy to install.
positive,Easy to use and install but not very durable over the long haul.
positive,Seriously - it's a crank.  It opens an RV vent.  I was glad to find this on Amazon.  What more can I say??
positive,Great looking and easy installation.  Would purchase again.
positive,Work great
positive,I live in the snow belt of Michigan and boots carry a lot of snow on to the liners making them into wading pools.
positive,Just built a new home all the sockets were super hard to enter this helped us all not frustrated trying to plug in appliances
negative,"They fit and they work. Handling is at least as good as factory if not better. The only reason no 5 star rating is the springs are too tall! The front of my car ended up an inch or two higher than the back :( After about 10,000 miles the spring seems to have settled down to the correct height, but it was annoying.<br />Update - the ride height NEVER got totally back to normal."
positive,"It works great for our needs.  It makes a perfect omelet every time.  That's what we use it for.  And for cheese sandwiches.  I always spray or oil it first, I don't use high heat, and I don't put it in the dishwasher.  It is easy to clean by hand, and takes up less storage in the cupboard because it's thin and can slide it in-between things.  I have an average-sized double-sided kitchen sink. I can wash it in there conveniently.  However the larger Happycall pans would be more difficult for me to wash in my sink.  You might want to measure your sinks to see which sized Happycall pans would be best for your double-sink.  Those with single sinks shouldn't have a problem with any size Happycall.  And, as I always say, I never receive any free products for my reviews. They are done simply to be helpful.  Your reviews have helped me make decisions many times."
positive,excelent
negative,"Arms of jacket sewn to narrow, very uncomfortable, very unsafe when range of motion is #1 priority with all motorcycle gear."
negative,The handle broke after about 2 months on my vehicle with very limited use
positive,Product is nice.  For me it is a bit rough and uncomfortable.  It does cover the wheel with some padding.
positive,Great late work just as expected easy install would purchase again if needed
negative,"Not impressed by the install or performance!<br />Do not buy this one! Plus it blocks off your windshield washer fluid fill, you have to unscrew it every time you refill it!"
positive,not bad
positive,All I wanted was something to get the remaining water off after I go through the car wash.  This was perfect.
positive,Its compact and easy to use. Just set it start it and let it do its thing. Very nice.
positive,Exactly as advertised... Some 2din units run slightly bigger than this kit. My 173 x 97mm fits perfectly. Make sure you pay attention to this.
negative,"WARNING<br /><br />This spoiler does not fit a 2008 Maserati GT.<br /><br />The tape on the spoiler only makes about 2 inches of contact with the trunk and can not possibly be secured the vehicle. When pressed into position the ends of the spoiler touch but about 90 percent of the belly of the spoiler never makes contact. I am very disappointed. Not to mention the spoiler hits the Maserati chrome script which makes it unsightly and even less stable. (look in their pictures, they conveniently don't show Maserati's with the chrome lettering because the spoiler wont fit if the lettering is present.)<br /><br />The product was shipped from China in one massive styrofoam cutout that they taped together. while it protected the item the styrofoam fractured and will be a pain to ship back.<br /><br />The only good thing is that it is very pretty and I would have liked for it to be on my vehicle but it simply doesn't fit.<br /><br />I'm obviously frustrated but now I just want an easy return process, but I suspect the seller is going to run me around.<br /><br />I'll try to add pictures and update this review when the seller responds."
negative,"The air freshener smells good.  Like most air fresheners, this one won;t last for long.  What else can be said about such a basic product?"
negative,"Overpriced Parts and Shipping, but they work well."
negative,Nice product but seller should just help by putting dimensions of the pads. This doesn’t fit Land Rover LR4.
positive,Charged them when I received them. Both voltages settled the same and they were then connected in parallel. Working great so far.
negative,"Awful quality. A quarter weighs more than these do. The paw print isn't even as big as it is in the picture. It only takes up about half of the top of the cap, and looks like a cheap plastic bubble sticker. Wouldn't even thread all the way onto my valve stems before binding."
positive,100 % satisfied
positive,Muy buen precio.
positive,I attached this to my sun visor and it holds two pairs of sunglasses well. The sunglasses are held well and don't seem loose like they will fall out. It is easy to put in and remove the sunglasses. The holder seems to be decent quality and like it should last a while. It does come with an adapter to attach to an air vent but I haven't used this
positive,Put it in my 2016 Yamaha FZ-09 ....and it works great
positive,As advertised.
positive,great replacement to original. will buy again
positive,"The organizers serve several different functions.<br />1)  They serve as a stop-gap so everything imaginable does not fall between your seats<br /><br />2)  They offer a beverage holder in addition to a larger compartment to hold various and sundry items. The area even has a slot which contains credit cards and/or driver’s licenses perfectly.  Excellent if you’re traveling and you prefer not to dig for a payment method when stopping for gasoline.<br /><br />3)  They fit snugly. Hence there’s no unnecessary slipping around<br /><br />4)  The cord(s) for the LED lighting inconspicuously and easily threads into the vehicle’s console to plug into the supplied adapter<br /><br />5)  The LED lights not only look fabulous but are pragmatic in that you can actually see what and where you placed the items<br /><br />6)  The company is one of the best vendors I’ve ever dealt with on Amazon.  They take pride in their product and service.  It shows too.<br /><br />Yeah, these cost a bit more but you won’t be throwing your hard-earned money away.  I tried a few other brands of these types of products and to me, they were a huge disappointment. They didn’t stay in place, they didn’t offer any type of ability to organize things and they sure as heck didn’t look the way these do or add any panache to the vehicle’s appearance.  These KEKETUOHAI organizers perform perfectly and look amazing. The LED lights come on when your vehicle’s power is engaged.<br /><br />And a kind of fun anecdote…As I was stopped at a traffic light the other morning on my way to the beach for my early walk, a police SUV pulled up next to me and the officer rolled down his window.  From his elevated vantage point he was checking out my vehicle’s interior. The KEKETUOHAI organizers were lit up (it was 0530-ish) and the officer said me how cool it looks. My vehicle’s interior happens to have LED lights so combined with the organizers…yeah, it does look cool if I do say so myself. But these will be a great addition to any vehicle irrespective of its interior lights because they are a great product with great design features.<br /><br />Order these. You won’t be disappointed."
positive,Product used to replace older wiring harness. Easy to route and install.
positive,I tested this product on the face of my Sony Walkman with a foam applicator and it took out most of the scratches and scuff marks without much effort.  I then used it to remove the swirl marks in my black window rain/wind deflectors and within a minute or so of medium hand buffing they looked much better.  So for the price it works very well.
positive,so far so good..... lets see if it holds and passes test of time
negative,"I ordered the dye kit {as pictured,w/leather prep sponge,etc} and got the shoe polish cream,in a small round flat glass jar.Mistake in the warehoouse The cream is probably ok,but the leather needs to be dyed first..."
negative,"Not what I expected, they are okay,"
positive,"I keep vehicles for a long, long time and have used BG44 in them for years.  My Acura MDX has 204.000 miles on it and gets 23 mpg average.  I credit BG44 for the performance."
positive,"These were simple to install.  My Forester has dust covers that still fit after installing these.  Beam is almost exactly the same as with halogens, except much brighter.  Cutoff line at same height.  Very happy that I chose these.<br />Only installed them one week ago.  Will update review once I can comment on longevity.<br />UPDATE:  NO PROBLEMS AFTER 2 YEARS! ! ! !"
positive,Great fit in the small feont window of my 2015 wrangler
positive,"The locking hitch pin bolt made by Hollywood works very well with my Hollywood Trail Rider hitch rack. This kit can be used with the cable looped around the bicycles on your rack or with only the lock which secures only the threaded hitch pin. The locking pin replaces the stock non-locking pin. It inserts just like stock, it threads and tightens perfectly. The locking portion slips over the end of the bolt and snaps onto the groove of the pin. I have a Curt class 3 hitch on my Dodge Charger and there are no clearance problems. The locking mechanism is smooth and operates properly with the supplied keys. There are four keys provided and all four keys operate the hitch lock as well as the cable lock that comes with this set-up. The cable is for locking the bicycle/s to the rack.  The cable is a thin plastic coated metal cable. The lock operates smoothly and snaps closed when engaged. Easy to operate. Hint. I use a rechargeable ratchet with a 16mm deep well socket to tighten and loosen the threaded hitch because my receiver is tucked under the rear bumper. Much less of a hassle.<br /><br />This is a reasonably priced item and you get what you pay for at $34.95  Nothing about this security system inspires confidence. High security locks are closer to $100.  It is in my opinion only capable of preventing a spur of the moment runoff. The sneeze of an experienced bike thief would blow this system into pieces. I personally don't live in a major metropolitan area so this an adequate set-up for me."
positive,Went on easily and works well.
negative,No difference from any other hose I have used. Still tastes like hose and connections leak unless you get them twisted just right.
positive,"Works great, lasts a long time, quality construction."
positive,"Very close to an OEM product, wait to see how behave with age."
positive,Works wonders
positive,Great- second one we have purchased. Last several years.
positive,works as expected
positive,Use Teflon spatula to spread it and feather it out. Don’t use the beush.
positive,"I have a 4WD pickup that I use to access beaches without roads.  Airing down makes riding over rocks, sand  and lava easier and smoother.  I set these at 20 psi and they are accurate to within 5%.  Once they are set, it takes a minute to screw them on and 3 minutes to air down.  I carry a 10 gallon tank of compressed air for the end of the trip, which is not quite enough to get all four tires to 32, but going home with 30 psi is not a problem.  Hard to find a 12 gallon tank.  Anyway, once these are set, they are a breeze to use."
negative,Filter split at the hose clamp fitting area in under a year. I'll be looking for a different brand.
positive,Love these lights. My second pair. Made strong and brute. I put them behind my grill on the truck.
positive,"I got these for my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2) primarily to use as fog lights so they would match the color of the (more expensive) LED's that I had put in the low beam projectors. For this purpose they worked great. The color was right and the light output was admirable for the price paid. I really wasn't expecting much so I thought the fog light application would serve as a good test bed.<br />About 6 months later, my more expensive low beam LED's started to fail (I won't explicitly mention the name of their manufacture, but I will say I got them from a company with the initials of XD). Since I was in a pinch, I pulled the Auxbeam LED's out of the fogs and put them in the low beam projectors, and I must say I was impressed. Now don't get me wrong,.. these aren't particularly 'high power', but for the price and lack of fan? Yeah, these exceeded my expectations. An added bonus is that I'm not getting even a hint of flickering or error messages on my Jeep."
positive,Awesome product! Perfect fit for the PT and easily installed in minutes! Love the fresh look they give the Cruiser and it really turns heads now with all the new Bling! Highly Recommended. The price is perfect. I looked all over the web and this was the best price out there.
positive,"These worked perfect with my 2009 G6. The OEM units were $120 each. In the chilly Wisconsin winters, having my remote start back is amazing!"
positive,Took a couple of weeks to ship from Europe but worth the wait for the inexpensive but genuine item for my Audi.
negative,"I've had both now and these somehow losing their shape? Weird, but like they're flattening themselves out. On first install, they fit fine, much like Weathertech matts, but after a few weeks, they seem to have changed shape. Probably a materials issue. Anyway, they're OK, for the price, but spend a few $'s more and get the real thing is all I can say. Or buy these from me for a discount and I'll go buy Weathertechs..."
positive,This product kept my car illuminated during a night time drive.
positive,Excellent instructions. Works well. Took 10 minutes or less to install. Worth $25 for sure.
positive,Looks cool with minor signal loss.
positive,Decent lights at a good price.  I would have given 5 stars if they would have included the right size bolts to put them together.  I have to add spacers to make them fit.
positive,My wife bought some friend chicken and put it on the seat of the car. The grease went through the bag and stained our light grey back sit. I sprayed some of this and let it sit for about 5 minutes to penetrate. I then used my drill brush to scrub it good and then cleaned it off with a damp rag. Stain went immediately away. Definitely recommend
negative,I bought these for my 1982 cb750sc. They just dont fit. Could not get the carbs back on the bike with these. had to use old ones. Do not buy.
positive,I did not purchase.  A huge thank you to this company! They provide clear photos of the style cup holders their product will NOT fit!  Which includes my 2013 Lexus. Saved both of us time and hassle. Thank you for your excellent photos!
positive,Product arrived on time and as expected.
positive,Wiper arm assembly was exactly as the factory one. Works great!
positive,"Very simple design and installation.  Very secure clamp.  Unlike some others, this one is rock solid, even at speed over rough roads.  It is very quick and easy to secure the phone in the mount, and remove it when you are done.  I bought this for my wife, who has an iphone 5, and it fits even with her credit cardflip case installed.  Not as securely as when the bare phone is secured, but good enough for our 30-50 mile rides (and would be fine for any distance).  I don't typically carry my phone with me, but I did buy another mount for my bike, should I go on a tour or something.  For the price it is a great value.  I have not tried it on a mountain bike, so I cannot comment on that use."
positive,Good quality and durable. Impressed.
positive,Easy to install and work well with my sheepskin seat covers
positive,Great!!
positive,Fit my 387
negative,"I installed the bulb, the light is whiter, however, I realized whiter does not mean brighter.  It is much dimmer than my original light bulb."
positive,This is so good and holds the hood very easily. It also opens the hood
positive,"I have a new SUV and the gap is very tight between the chair and console, so this fits just perfect and did not need to use the velcro it comes with. It does not move, fills the gap so nothing can fall. I put mail, my phone, coins etc. I am very happy with the purchase.."
positive,"I bought this to replace the plug on my RV.  I love the handle on it which makes it much easier to unplug.  The only issue is that it is larger than my old plug so it will not go inside the plug door on my RV. It has to hang outside which is not a problem but looks a little tacky.  I plan to replace the plug door on that compartment to help the situation in the future. Easy to install and worth the money,"
positive,arrived and fit as expected.  Easy to install after watching video from search 'replace 2002 focus headlight'.
negative,Doesn't work very well on a single cylinder - laggy.
positive,"It's those times when you need tools like these & don't have them. And not having them only serves to make the job way harder than it needs to be. So, even if you do just the occasional service on your car, just pick these up now & throw them in your tool box. They are super inexpensive, well made & you get a great assortment. Just one tool for removing dash trim is worth the price of the entire kit (versus using something like a flat head screwdriver!)."
negative,Paint on the inside peeled off at 300 miles. The 90degree corners have ridges and are not flat caused it to leak.<br />Solution: peeled off the remaining paint off with a plastic putty knife and steel wool. Applied Permatex Sealant in the pan before transmission pan gasket to seal all the ridges.
positive,This was an excellent replacement for my factory original. A $15.00 part prevented me from operating my car and this was the perfect fix. Very easy install. Highly recommended and I give it 5 stars.
positive,Lol work great look even better
positive,"Easy to install, and especially useful if you have the ""integrated"" washer system, as replacing the blades is much less expensive than replacing the whole arm.<br /><br />-J"
positive,"Good product for the price, I was a bit disappointed with the quality of this product, but for the price what do you expect."
positive,Worked GREAT
positive,Fit was very close to the outline of the WS and is very insulated with thicker material than the cheap Auto Parts store covers that are flimsy collapse easily.  It can get very hot on a summer afternoon so be careful! Great product for your money!
positive,"very easy to install, looks and feels great!"
positive,Easy to install and weight distribution w/ sway control
positive,"Cheapest decent looking new bumper I could find online.  Was shipped very quickly, arrived in good condition and looks great on the vehicle.  Can't tell from the original other than the lack of rot through everywhere.  Great buy"
positive,No comment
positive,Very pleased with this product snd the delivery was prompt.
positive,USED ON MUD TRUCK TO ALLOW FRESH AIR TO CARBS  !!!!<br />USED ON MUD TRUCK TO ALLOW FRESH AIR TO CARBS--WORKED PERFECT  !!!  BC
positive,I really like these mats for my 650!  The carpet mats were thrown away because they kept getting caught up in my pedal.
positive,These look like they will work great when needed. Havent used yet but bought for the times i could have really used them in the past. I don't remember reading it anywhere when purchasing these but the are stamped deep &#34;made in usa&#34; ill be looking at what else lisle has to offer too!
positive,Very easy to install and do the job. Just needed to bend it a little bit because my attach was little bit larger
positive,Fit my 85 200x as expected.  I am not getting great braking with these however.
positive,"This is another fabulous book in the HOT SEAL Team series with Cody McCormick finding the love of his life with Miranda, a CIA operative. They met when she stuck a gun in his ribs and asked him to keep walking at a casino in Vegas. He could have disarmed her but he wanted to see what she was up to and if she needed his help. She had no idea he was a Navy SEAL with the HOT unit and noticed two men following her from the Condo organization because they found out her true identity when she was undercover. She was out to avenge the death of her mentor Mark. Cody was helping Miranda hide in a safe house until he was ordered to surrender her to the CIA because they told him she was a rogue agent. In the meantime they had slept together and had stronger feelings for each other. How the CIA handled the whole situation left Cody devastated. Several weeks later when Cody was still reeling from her death and drink he was attacked by Conti's men. He easily handled them but was surprised by their HOT unit boss Mendez when told about their next assignment. Things get really exciting when a CIA operative was forced to go on this special assignment to capture Son to with them and it was no other than Miranda with a different identity. This story is action packed as Cody and Miranda fall in love and work together with the whole team to complete this difficult op. It had some surprising circumstances that rocked Miranda's world which left her feeling confused and betrayed. It is amazing how well they all the HOT SEALs work together and have each other's backs even though they are from different branches of the military. Cody and Miranda get their happily ever after as another Hot SEAL member finds happiness. This series is terrific and I cannot wait to read the next release in this romantic suspenseful series."
positive,Works as described.
positive,These are very sturdy and is a great value for the money.
positive,I used it on my 1985 Chevrolet K-30 military pickup because the replacement wiper motor no longer has the washer pump included.  It was an easy install as a universal replacement.  I didn't actually need all the parts.  Thumbs up to the manufacturer for such a complete kit at a great price.
negative,"Packaging was not the best, came in a plastic bag that was ripped and product was scratched up a bit because of it.  I guess I expected 'Heavy duty' to be really heavy duty.  I felt the product was somewhat flimsy.  I do not like to write anything negative but I think the product should not advertize it to be more then what it is."
positive,My 18yr old son put it on and likes it just fine. He said it was not that hard to install
negative,"It looks great, but is very thin.  The included &#34;hardware&#34; is a joke.  Be prepared to figure out a way to mount it solidly yourself.  It would actually have been better if they had included nothing at all, because what's there is, again, a joke.  It's overpriced, and not nearly as sturdy as a plastic one I have on another truck.  The upside is it looks really nice, but don't think it's as tough or thick gauge as a real truck behind-the-cab tool box. Nope."
positive,"Something cute, classy, and functional for the car."
positive,"Well made and sturdy. Attaches securely and easily. Grease goes in smoothly. Sturdy ever. The tip is longer than some others I have, but the overall quality is much better. Recommended."
positive,"Great looking knob.<br />Comes with 3 adapter sleeves.<br />Easy to install.<br />Looks close to factory(or better) for my 2008 Mazda 3 Grand Touring Hatchback.<br />Has good weight to eat, feels nice in the hand."
positive,"Great scan tool for money, friend has one he paid 140 for and this does all the same as his. Don't be fooled buy this even has a nice case"
positive,"Second time I have purchased this for our vehicles, easily cleans the windshield regardless of the angle"
negative,2nd one in 13 months.. of course seller won’t do anything about the first one ..  just buy it locally (auto zone ) life time warranty.. not worth the $35 difference
positive,Everything about this is great and a wonderful towel along with it
positive,worth it.
positive,I love these seat covers.  I have bought many cheap seat covers over the years and these form fit the seats and also add a little more cushion. I like how they are soft and whip down easy as well. The instal was ok I just always have a hard time trying to fit my hand under my seat.  Over great product and hopefully they last longer then the cheaper ones.
positive,super set of tools for disconnects glow plug and fuel injectors on diesels.
positive,"As an Uber/Lyft driver, this is a MUST have!  Before I ordered it, I had a passenger who was nice enough to puke all over my back seat.  It took hours to clean, including removing the seat from the vehicle.  With this product on my interior, I don't have to worry about things soaking in.  Water beads up and can easily be mopped up with a towel."
positive,Replacement part for my car. Husband recommended this brand and he loves them!
negative,This wheel IS NOT a direct replacement on a 2003 Honda Civic EX. Honda requires a hub centric wheel and this is not a hub centric wheel. The center of the wheel is significantly larger than the hub. Do not buy this wheel because it will shake. I was able to center it well with the lug nuts but it still shakes a little. Avoid this wheel.<br /><br />Edit: 4/16/20. I'm replacing this wheel and throwing it in the recycling pile. I see it is still inaccurately described as a fit for 01-05 civic with 15 inch wheels. Seller should probably address this issue. Dorman sells a hub centric wheel for this car. Avoid this product
positive,"This hood protector fits my 2021 Honda CRV perfectly.<br />The low profile look is a nice addition to my vehicle.<br />Adhesion seems good upon installing but time will tell about the longevity of adhesion.<br />BEWARE of the surface application packet !<br />As per enclosed directions, this step is neccessary, but carefully apply the enclosed liquid saturated pad ONLY to the exact hood area where the adhesive tape will touch.<br />The liguid residue in the pad will discolor the vehicles paint.<br />If the paint becomes discolored then you must apply mineral spirits to remove the residue.<br />Also this residue will be on your fingers and anywhere you touch will retain this fingerprint residue and again mineral spirits will be needed to remove it."
positive,Practico y fácil de usar
positive,"Haven't had a chance to use mine yet, but I tried out my friend's before I purchased. Makes it much easier."
positive,"There are directions included with the mirror, but difficult to read and follow. My mirrors rotate 90-degrees for trailer towing. To remove old mirrors, wear gloves and safety glasses, rotate out into trailer tow position, push bottom in, grab from the top and pull up, use a plastic door panel tool or putty knife to help push up, both my old mirrors which were already broken, cracked some more, so place a trash can under the mirror to catch broken shards of mirror. Found an excellent video on you tube showing how to do this. After the mirror is released, disconnect the heater wires. Install is easy, connect wires, line up clips and push down to lock into place."
negative,i filled this gun from a tub as i did not have a cartridge. the grease ran out of the bottom as soon as i released the plunger. It does not appear to have a seal. i sent a message to the seller and still have not heard from them
positive,Awesome product.  Just what we needed.
positive,"NEED TO KNOW INFO:<br /><br />Additional costs will occur.<br /><br />1: Bypass Modulator (what tells the truck it's ok for the Viper to control the ignition)<br /><br />2: Professional installation (this is not a DIY kit and since this is like heart surgery vs gauled bladder surgery, it's a good idea to go ahead and have someone well trained and insured and/or offering a warranty, to put this baby in. No instructions are included)<br /><br />Just because there are all those wires, it doesn't mean they all apply to your vehicle.<br /><br />It is easier to operate than it may seem to be. Just push the button for a couple seconds. It'll either crank right up or as soon as you are in range of the Viper it will crank up.<br /><br />You will have an antenna in your vehicle probably on windshield.<br /><br />You'll lose your current stock anti theft system.<br /><br />Your horn will no longer beep when you lock it.<br /><br />YOU SHOULD TELL THE TECHNICIAN EXACTLY HOW LONG YOU WANT THE TIMER SET TO FOR THE VEHICLE TO RUN AFTER YOU REMOTE START IT. (I have 10 min  and wish I had known to make it 15 min)<br /><br />It's an all day thing so plan for alternate means of transportation that day.<br /><br />FINALLY... Enjoy your vehicle every time you get in it because you now have a Viper!"
positive,"This LED is very high quality and unique design, excellent job and design also very bright I loved"
positive,Highly recommend it. Very convenient also!
positive,Best quality on the market
positive,"Installed and fit perfect. they really dress up the tail lights and stand out at night. Easy to install, Heavy and well made to last. My daughter calls it her jewelry for her truck  and she cannot wait to get more!"
positive,These work great! Very easy to clean too!
positive,Super easy to install and work great.
positive,Fit perfectly and retains original size and looks.
negative,"I mounted these on my 2015 Yamaha FZ09. Very little adjustment, poor quality, I am returning the produce immediately. Didn't expect wonders as they were $20 but I couldn't see anything at all once mounted and when it was set to see behind they were so low and close to the grips I couldn't even grab the grips, let alone reach the clutch or brake. Maybe if it came with a ton of spacers and much longer screws they could be usable. Do not be fooled by the &#34;Rizoma&#34; written on it, nothing but an illegal trademark infringement."
positive,"put this on an opel gt, and it meelowed out the sound while driving vs straight pipe. good buy. sounds good"
positive,"These front trunk lifts are a great addition to my Tesla model 3. It's a shame that the stock lifts don't automatically open the hood. But it's nice that third parties are making their own versions. Installation was fairly simple and I was able to do it on my own, however if you have a friend it would make it easier. Now whenever you remotely open the front trunk, it will open all the way!"
positive,Keeping things together and simple.
positive,my friend loved it as a gift cute sticker!
positive,They are good cloths for all your needs.
positive,Works like a champ!
positive,Fit good
positive,"I was afraid they wouldn't fit and were smaller than what I needed for my 2000 CRV, but my family and I installed these headlights and I'm pleased with them. I think the installation was a little difficult because of my vehicle being about 16 years old and having original parts. We had to work and shimmy to remove the old ones and replace the lights. But these are shiny, new, clean and they do the job. I'm satisfied."
positive,exact match
negative,"Absolute garbage. I bought these for my husband for Christmas, ordered specifically for his style truck, and upon arrival the instructions were for LED lights (these are not LED), very difficult to follow even if they were for our vehicle, there was about a 1/2 inch gap around the outside of both lights which looked REALLY bad and quite tacky, the mounting tabs were present on one light and absent on the other, and there was some other piece (have no clue what it was) on one that was not on the other. Not to mention, my husband had to go out and buy different bulbs to fit these lights, and even then the lights did not square up evenly with the bulbs and wires, rendering them impossible to install. Requested a return, which was answered very promptly, but upon sending them out at our nearest drop-off location we learned we had to spend $27 on shipping. I feel that spending our money on shipping for a defective item is absurd and out of the question. READ THE OTHER REVIEWS AND DO NOT ORDER THESE. Waste of time and now money. Only gave 1 star because there wasn't an option for no stars. VERY disappointed."
positive,Awesome product just as advertised and it’s really good quality. Easy to install and they look nice.
positive,"Meguiars Citrus blast wash and wax cleans and polishes your car in one step. Meguiars cuts through the dirt, grime, and bugs with ease really getting your vehicle clean. Then with a quick rinse, your car or truck will have a great Meguiars shine."
positive,"I bought these seat covers because I have leased cars and dogs. The original set is now being used on my new car and while they’re starting to look a bit faded , they’ve been great. I used them in a Honda FIT and an HRV but am getting myself a new set and giving the old ones to a friend with a Subaru Forester.<br />For the money ,these have exceeded all expectations . I also have the rear bench seat cover .<br />Highly recommended."
positive,"Looks great, the only thing I noticed is there are no notches to adjust the headlights"
positive,Great having a start available if the battery goes dead.....  our bike eats batteries.... so this would have been handy
negative,"I liked the idea of this product far more than the reality. It was a beast to install because it wouldn’t stick despite following the directions carefully. I ended up using some super heavy duty double sided tape. Even then, the ones in the back seat came off the first day my kids were back there. It also doesn’t bend around corners. I ended up having to cut slits in the material to get it to bend. It’s definitely not snazzy anymore."
positive,This is a fantastic hat.  I love the style and the fit and wear it all the time.  It came promptly and in perfect condition.  I would buy from this seller again.
negative,Fits barely does not look good.
positive,"Love them, the work great"
positive,"Works great on my 2017 WRX. Takes some adjusting to make it not TOO tight (getting into 1st is rather important!), but takes a lot of the slop out of the stick."
negative,"Straight forward instal drill holes and mount. Super bright and really like the way they match my tail lights and other exterior lighting. However, first time it rained one was very wet inside, the other seems fine. Can’t find the contact info for the seller though so I can put a claim in on the 1 year warranty though."
positive,"Wow !<br />Another great product from CRC .Top of the line Automotive products .<br />One drawback is it's messy to use ,but works great !"
positive,Works for my Ford F250 and wife's Sequoia in positioning vehicles in the garage so that all of the doors and tailgates can be opened with enough room. My only comment which is slightly negative is that the sticky tape on the bottom to hold their position is not very strong. I used some duct tape on the  edge that the tires contact to help.
positive,Works great. Easy to install on my pop up camper
positive,Perfect fit for my 02 nissan sentra
positive,It's a great light but to bright at night good for box trucks
positive,Look great on my 2008 jeep patriot.
positive,"Bought this for and installed it on a 2002 Chevrolet trailblazer 4x4 4.2L straight 6.  This part was replacing an aftermarket one that lasted approximately 45k miles.  Installation was  simple and only took about 20 minutes.  It came with the necessary gasket.  The part is well made and was visibly better constructed than the aftermarket part it was replacing.  Its been running for 8k miles with no leaks, noises or other issues."
positive,It fits
positive,Worth every penny looks and work better than I thought it would A+
positive,The roof rack has met all expectations<br />They were easy to install and the cost was quite less than coming from a dealer<br />The other thing they came in a silver color which looks better than the black offered at the dealer<br />I would recommend
positive,"The color is so good, and I love it. One problem is that the smell is so strong that takes a few days for it to go way"
positive,"fit perfect, been workig fine for 2 seasons now"
negative,Purchased two one for each of my machines. Only one worked. 50% fail rate. Lost hours figuring out NEW switch was bad. Save time and money purchase OEM.
positive,"The price, function, and size can't be beat!  No more storing the bulky jumper cables in an easy-to-reach spot, but still carry them with the spare tire as a precaution.<br /><br />On the other hand, this compact jump starter is small enough to be placed in our Suburban door storage pocket, out of the way, yet in plain sight!<br /><br />Hubby is impressed with this tool, he said that it feels so good, not counting on someone else to help us out, if we accidently leave the lights on inside - which has happened several times while our kids were growing up.<br /><br />Now that the tiny people are all grown up, it isn't as much of a threat, but you never know... And we'll be ready!"
negative,"The back seat bottom is not right for a 2012 Kia Soul. The bottom of the seat in the vehicle does not move to thread straps through! The front seats, well you get what you pay for! Will make due until hopeful Christmas update!"
positive,"This sucker keeps everything in! And the bag doesn't slip down or out! That's a lifesaver with two littles and half-living in our van! It's huge. Holds a ton of trash. It fell over during a sharp turn, and nothing spilled out! Huzzah! Worth every penny!"
positive,Fit perfectly quick replacement
positive,"Very tough, good looking, effective protection"
negative,Guess I'll have room drill drain holes. Of course that will be the spot where rust will start.
negative,This is for the Model 3 and Y not the new Model S and X.
negative,"Works great with thicker ice and snow accumulation, but not great with just frost. The real reason for 1 start...it came apart. The small end came right off. Not worth the money."
positive,"fast shipping, fit perfect."
negative,"i don't know why high flow would be a selling point. i would prefer better filtration to high flow. these filters are cheap and better than factory, but compared to the mobil 1, the media is a little more porous and lighter. i can only assume its such high flow because tons of stuff just gets through it so easily."
positive,"Build quality looks great on these. I've seen a lot of cheap LED pods and they don't look or feel cheap. They do have some heft to them and the electrical connector and moisture relief valve look good. Mounting bracket looks sturdy and the hardware they come with is good as well.<br /><br />However, they definitely do not have much reach. They provide a VERY wide light pattern, but it's really only good for 10-15 feet out. Farther than that and I just don't see them being very useful. I mean, some light is definitely better than no light! But just make sure what you're using them for is for lighting up stuff nearby.<br /><br />They also seem to be a little greener than other yellow/amber lights."
positive,Quality decal. USPS lost my order. Contacted seller and they got another awesome red vinyl squirrel decal on its way to me immediately. I put it on my onewheel helmet and the chicks dig it.
positive,Good pin
positive,"This is the best thing ever! I received it on time and it was packaged nicely. It comes in a nice case too. It arrived almost fully charged but I plugged it in and charged it the rest of the way. It's a USB charger so it's easy to charge up. My van has a slow battery drain that we can't find so I need to start it up every other day or the battery is dead. Luckily, I received this and took it outside to try it out. It was really easy to use, just plug the cables into the unit, turn it on, put the cables on the battery, and try to start it. Well, it worked on the first try! Who knew a little unit could save the day?!?! No more needing to wait for my hubby to get home to jump my van for me!"
positive,Fram's reputation plus a reasonable price equals a good buy...
positive,"So far,only had to use once,but it works great, ice comes off easily and no scratching"
negative,"Nice little kit. Everything thing you need to get started, but it takes more than 2 squeeze's to tighten and cut. I would personally prefer a different one."
positive,"Showed up promptly, and is exactly what I need."
positive,"Here's the beauty, as well as a little secret about this product. I put a third of a bottle of this product mixed with two thirds of warm water. Shake it up and spray it all over my car. Then I take my car to the Touchless Car Wash. This result is a deep lustrous shine rivaling a detail shine."
negative,"Work great, feel great but Squeak like crazy at stopping at very slow speeds.  Have pulled off cleaned and greased still squeak.  Not sure where it comes from. Praying it will stop.  Don't want to pull the brakes  off again. 😩"
positive,"If you're anything like me you take your water bottle with you everywhere, which means taking it in the car. Most cars don't have cup holders large enough to hold a water bottle and so you throw it in the passenger seat. Inevitably it ends up on the floorboard while in traffic. And forget trying to reach for it.<br />This cup holder expander solves your water bottle predicament! It has opened a whole new world of hydration to me since ordering it.<br />I have road tested it for you and even took a video while slamming on the breaks. This expander gets the job done and is made with quality materials."
positive,"Like many car owners, I found my front license plate being bent significantly each time I went through a car wash. I was looking for a solution to this problem and found it with this product!<br /><br />I flatten the license plate as best as I could before inserting it into the Dorman plate frame. Installing the plate and frame back on the front bumper was a piece of cake. After going through the car wash yesterday, the license plate remained flat inside the frame. Problem solved!"
positive,It arrived quickly and I am super pleased with the quality!
positive,It is cute and stays in place. It is perfect for any soccer mom.
positive,"Quality part, torqued down and threaded perfectly."
positive,"Great comfort in my small car, makes it drivable for longer distances. Wish it was slightly longer back to front, but helps so much having the extra cushion."
positive,Works as it should and the blue light at the end of the gauge helps in dark situations.
positive,Rey. Right. So far so good.
positive,Awesome.  These were perfect and did the job!<br />Easy to install and work great!
negative,"Used it twice. Battery dead already. Won't charge back up. Purchased in August 2019, useless on October 27th 2019. To late  for return, so...plastic piece of garbage."
positive,"Bought this as a gift and he loves it. Easy instructions! Quick shipping, quality product and well worth the money. Will update once decal is put on.<br /><br />Update: decal is easy to install and looks great on the truck. It's one size and you cut to fit. Following instructions will help you be successful when putting it on. Be sure to line up the bottom stripe."
positive,Looks like great quality as good or better than o e m
positive,works 2002 gmc envoy
negative,way too expensive and dont stick on so well
positive,Easy to use. Suggest using a large Popsicle stick to spread it around.
positive,it fit but didn't solve the code 25 problem
positive,These work great on our 2008 Wrangler!  We have a lift on it so these do the job for getting in and out. Easy install
positive,"Works as expected, fits well. No issues"
positive,"I live in Atlanta and these people drive like they don’t care about their life so it’s not very effective here😹 it’s usually just cause for people to harass me on the road because it makes it obvious that I’m a child 🧍🏾‍♀️*old man in the red pickup truck who almost hit ME cuz he was so close, had the nerve to honk at ME😒* but VERY EASY ON AND OFF, stuck on through a whole thunderstorm!!! If you live in a place where people can drive, y’all should get it‼️ Also, surprisingly the nicest people on the road are the ones who drive the sports cars🥰 LOVE TO ALL DODGE CHARGER, SCAT, HELLCAT, MUSTANG, etc I appreciate y’all! Y’all always let me over on the road even in heavy traffic 🥺"
negative,I would not buy again. Plastic is too thin. I broke one right away. They did fit my gas can as advertised.
positive,As advertised.  Works great!
positive,Very cool 4 the $$! V8 Grand sounds street sweet!
positive,works great
positive,excellent
positive,"Both the Key and the Keyless opener/engine start work GREAT! The Dealership price for the opener was 85.00 itself.  I found the dearer was the least expensive way to get the key cut and opener programmed.  A local locksmith wanted $50.00 to program the opener and additional $5.00 to cut the key. The local dealership did both for $40.00. Great product works GREAT, my vehicle is a 2006 Chevrolet Malibu."
positive,"Great price and value! I've seen many products that are similar and way more expensive! This one performs as advertised and is light weight and durable,not heavy or bulky, Fit pefect!"
positive,Received a pair of shock and installed.  it make the ride much smooth.
positive,This CV Drive Axle is exactly like the original one. Very well made and fit like a glove.
negative,They fit well and are well made. however after installing I was not overly impressed.  Could not feel much of anything different. (2017 civic si)
positive,This is OEM motor oil for Mercruiser. It has kept my boat running for 10 years. I'll keep using it!
positive,Perfect fit for my Mazda CX-5 2016 and reasonable price.
positive,My second purchase of this item on my other motorcycle to mount my GoPro
positive,Just like OEM at a lower price .. super easy to install ..
negative,"This is a rather bizarre story. I am an Amazon VINE reviewer, so I did not have to pay for this item. As such, I did not bother looking at how much the unit sells for. After trying it out I went to look up the price though and am absolutely shocked to see that this thing is selling for nearly $150.<br /><br />I've tested probably a dozen products similar to this and never have I seen one priced at over $100. Most of them cost between $30 and $75. The specs are all nearly the same. They do the same thing. They are similar sizes. They have similar accessories. What makes this one worth $150? Absolutely nothing.<br /><br />The product does work as advertised. It does exactly what it says it does. It just isn't worth $150 or anywhere remotely near that. You would have to be crazy to pay that much.<br /><br />While taking a look at the product page I also noticed that the manufacturer claims that the product is UL Listed. No. It is not. In fact, this thing does not even come with a power adapter. UL only certifies products that plug directly into a wall outlet. Claims like ""UL Listed"", ""FCC Certified"" and ""FDA Approved"" are commonly made by Chinese manufacturers hoping to make their products sound better than they really are. Unfortunately for consumers, these claims are often outright lies, as is the case here. Underwriter's Laboratories has never tested or certified this product. Period.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this product is a joke or what. Although it does seem to hold a charge, I would not want to trust my battery to a company that has no contact information and who makes false advertising claims. And I most certainly wouldn't pay $100 more for a product than most of its competitors charge."
positive,"Great Product, Black License Plate Frame, Thank You"
positive,"So far So good , it's a little difficult getting them in but once you do they work great."
positive,Great decal. Went on easy. Looks really good on my car. And Breaking Benjamin is one of my favorite groups. So its perfect!
negative,"About what you'd expect for the price, but does the job"
positive,Works as expected.
positive,Good product
positive,"Work fine, but make sure to follow manufacturer's instructions when installing.  Need to run DRY wipers for two minutes to coat windshield with Rain-X product when you first get them and BEFORE using them in the rain."
positive,Rescued an old Mackie mixer with this stuff. It's liquid gold for electronics. Everyone should have at least one can of this stuff.
positive,Installed and works fine fine for 1/2 price of local
positive,good value
positive,Perfect for the back of the car
positive,"I saved about $85 over the cost of a genuine Lexus replacement mirror.  This mirror looks good and has a firm quality feel to it when switching the lever from day to night.  I don't have any problem with it shaking or vibrating like some reviews claim, but then the Lexus motors are balanced and blueprinted and are so smooth and quiet that the only way to know the engine is running when stopped at an idle is to look at the tach (one of the many reasons I love Lexus).  If one has an engine made by a cheaper manufacturer, and especially if it is a high-mileage, then shake could indeed be a problem (speaking as an auto-tech here).Be sure to have on hand some specialty automotive mirror adhesive."
positive,"Perfect door, well made, easy to install. And free shipping :)"
positive,"Carbyne triple packaged this tool which was fantastic, and delivered on time.  Will do a follow-up specifically on the tool once I use it."
negative,"This does the job to keep the sun out of my baby’s eyes, but no matter what I do I cannot get it to hang evenly or look anything like the photos. One side (usually the left) is always hanging separated from the glass, it’s super weird! The suction will not stay on for long either."
positive,I love these.  The price was right and it was a nice replacement to my old scuffed up ones that I have been using for years.
positive,beautiful easy to install upgrade for my boat cabin. They swivel and tilt and have a beautiful white light.
positive,"Alrighty, so I recently purchased a new Subaru Forester, and while I love the vehicle, my older car's sun shade did not fit correctly (too small). I searched for a variety of sun shades and found that while many say they would fit in the title or top description, the full description says they would not fit -- at least the model year. So, I looked to the dealer and choked on the $80+ price tag for a sunshade. I re-checked Amazon here and, I think by accident, found this one. It was a fair price, and repeatedly said it was for my specific model, so I thought I would give it a try. After a minor challenge to figure out which way was up, I can share with you these insights:<br /><br />The share works well as far as blocking the sun and keeping the interior cooler. I would say the inside was about 20° cooler as opposed to nothing. The overall product is good, easy to use and all, but I found that despite being designed to fit the Forester, it does not quite fit around the built-in eye-sight device and has to be placed over the top of it and then around the mirror to initially stay in place. The panels are large enough to cover the entire window but still require the use of the flip-down visors to hold it in place properly. All that aside, it does work decently, and despite some of the other comments, it is not all that hard to re-fold once you get the hang of the double-twist. I wish the top cut-out was better suited to fit around the eye-sight, and if it was, I'd say this was near perfect.  That is why I give this four instead of five starrs."
positive,Very easy to put it and work great
positive,"These are very handy to keep items off the floor, rolling around. Also holds my purse handle."
positive,"If you are looking for a great gun at a good price this one is for you. I have had this gun for 3 year and I do a ton of wood working and this gun puts an awesome finish on your work. I use it to spray shellac (Zinsser) and water based finishes (General Finishes). There is nothing worse then getting to the end of your project and your sprayer does a bad job and all your hard work is ruined. This sprayer will give you that great finish you are looking for. And yes you can buy cheaper sprayer, but it is just not worth it. Trust me I know.<br /><br />Love this gun..."
positive,"They definitely look like wood. I had to really inspect them closely to tell the difference and after installation I doubt I’d notice they are plastic. They have a usb charging port on the side, so for van dwellers this is a solid option for nightlights."
positive,Sturdy. Easy to use. Great price.
positive,"We wanted an extra set of keys, fob and all. Followed the instructions that came with the fob, programmed fine.  Range is no better or worse than the OEM fob I already had.  $10 is better than however much the dealer would have charged."
positive,Easy to use. Just what you think it is.
positive,Fits perfectly on my 2007 Lexus IS250 RWD. Brakes have been installed for a month and work great
positive,"My yard needed light, and my shed needed lighting/power. So I used these parts below to make a solar powered shed. My 2 yard lights run dusk to dawn (car battery handles that 20 watt load without stressing it) and light up WELL an area 20' out from shed, with enough light to see a person/animal another 30' at least.

positive,"They fit well and they don’t  vibrate making noise, 10 minute installation"
positive,Just What I Needed
positive,Just like the original
positive,Works
positive,I love this for our motorhome. Counter space is limited so having this in the sink instead of on the counter is a big help. Every little bit of saved counter space helps!
negative,Do not buy go with other seller. Drivers side torn with 2 wks on the side
positive,"It looks really nice and matches my car, it was also really easy to put on I didn’t need any help. I like it overall but I didn’t get the last reading, warmth I don’t know!"
positive,Super deal and great for my needs
positive,"I'm using this on a infrequently driven car.  After having several dead batteries because I didn't drive it often enough, and was too lazy to hook it up to the trickle charger (disconnect negative, clamp charger, plug in charger, reverse process when you want to drive), I decided to give this a try.<br /><br />This is installed so you don't hook your car up so much as simply plug it in.  Much easier in my opinion.  I pull in, plug in, done.  Battery is always charged, but not over charged, and there's no messing w/ clamps, terminals etc.  When its time to drive, I unplug and drive...definitely worth it."
positive,"They have been on the car for a year now, and are still working perfectly. This despite a blazing hot summer that can take a toll on rubber that is exposed to the sun (the car is parked outside). These replaced some Michelin blades bought while on a road trip that chattered horribly, right from the get-go."
positive,Wow these lights are cool. Very bright and so beautiful in color. I'm really glad I bought iBrightstar from all the others. These bulbs are great quality and their customer service is excellent.
positive,Worked well on my 2001 Yukon and waaay cheaper than the $200+ AutoZone wanted
positive,"I’ve been really putting this sticker through the test on my car. As a result of my job, I go through the car wash A LOT. My car is also subjected to intense heat and sun. These stickers stay the distance. They keep their color and don’t fade like ones I’ve ordered from different sellers."
positive,"Great for the price and adding the spare to the trailer instead of carrying it on the boat or in the back of the truck.  Keep the mount clean and dry as much as possible.  Powdered finishes don't stand up to salt water, especially in the South on the gulf."
positive,Like it.  But need better instructions
positive,"all went great,  it was as descbribed.,  i will be using it this summer,  can't wait to get to use it."
positive,Exactly what my hubby wanted.  I saw the exact same ones priced up to $300.00.  I paid just over $100.00
positive,Best adhesive on the market for weatherstrip and t-tops.
positive,Perfect lightweight and small.  Does what I need it to do and worked everytime. I purchased 2 of these and will update my review as needed as far as life span and durability. Purchase the car ring case for it you won’t regret it.
negative,"Use this but make sure u shake it , also when using it looks like anti freeze is all over your driveway , the smell is faint , would not buy again"
positive,"It's taken all the abuse I can throw at it. (plus, my 5yo son and the neighbor kid abuse it while it sits in the driveway) The thing still looks new, and hasn't shown any signs of working loose or deteriorating. two thumbs up.<br /><br />2002 chevy silverado 2500hd long bed"
positive,Excellent! Love it!
positive,"After reading the reviews , I decided to purchase this ECOGARD XC10218C Premium Cabin Air Filter for my Lex-GS 350.  Of course I sadly recalled that: A) the markup at the dealership is a substantial bite out of my purse savings, and B) the cost of labor at the dealership is an even larger bite out of said savings.<br /><br />Installation was a breeze and I’m confident if my pup had opposable thumbs, he could have easily performed this simple task  He’d also give it a two thumbs up…if only ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.  Oh well, Winston Churchill is still an amazing pupper.<br /><br />Please be mindful of the advice previously suggested by other reviewers.. Specifically, the arrow on the edge is NOT for indicating its top such as it is on the OEM filter..  Rather, this filter’s arrow is indicating placement towards your vehicle’s airflow.<br /><br />The quality is extremely dense. Seems like a good thing for filtering gunk.  And importantly, the cost didn’t even take a penny from my purse budget!<br /><br />Buy it, install it, and smile at your incredible automotive skills.<br />Ciao"
positive,"My new-to-me 2009 Cayman was due for it's winterizing oil change, and I didn't have the proper wrench to remove the oil filter cup.  This wrench was a very nice addition to my tool collection.  Solidly built, easy to clean, and it fits the filter cup like a glove.  Just a few dollars more than the cheap plastic versions, so why not get a good one?"
positive,Great buy
positive,Fits as well as a OEM product
positive,Great product!
positive,Worked great. Excellent value
positive,"Purchased as a Christmas gift,  I have no feedback at this time."
positive,Works good
positive,Fit perfect my 2008 GMC Yukon
positive,Works really good it’s on my truck now
positive,As advertised.  Good vendor.
positive,"Love this!  I am usually skeptical of gadgets, but this is worth every penny.  I can reach all the parts of the car, it doesn't damage the paint, it takes MUCH less time than a broom or a brush - I cleared a couple inches of snow from the car in 5 min.  Still need a brush for the mirrors and wipers and it doesn't do ice, but I am getting one for everyone I know that I am even vaguely fond of."
positive,Great product! No more metal to metal hammering sound! Jeeps runs very smoothly on light trail with high speed.
positive,Worked perfect on my 2009 Pontiac G6
positive,Good
positive,Works great! No shake!
negative,"This is ok and it works, I just have no idea how it works for a spare tire rack. There is no lug nut to attach it to.  Worst 7 dollars I have spent in a long while."
negative,"Blinks. oh, that is what it is for..."
negative,Won't last!
positive,Placed on my car with ease. Looks good.
negative,"Bought, didn't use.<br />I needed and asked for dimensions, got no straight answer.<br />Sellers SHOULD specify.<br />The hooks are 2"" wide and front lip is .8"" thick.<br />I'm returning, as they're wider than I need, plus one of the case latches arrived broke, due in part to POOR packing by Amazon and the POOR latch quality., which is reason for  star number."
positive,"Just as described in ad. Used it in our 2006 Dodge Charger, perfect fit."
positive,Love this wipers. My go to wipers
negative,"Okay, I bought this thing in hopes of getting a few dings out of my car but now I can see that there's a reason that there is an entire business around paintless dent repair - There is an art to it that takes experience. I started on the first dent and started turning the knob waiting for it to pop off - It never did. Instead, it put so much pressure on the two padded foam pieces that it made two new dents. So, I traded one tiny door ding for 3 dents now. I gave up after that first ding. I'll hire a paintless dent repair guy now. I'm not risking it again."
positive,"I ordered these for my purse, because the straps hurt my shoulder and the IV port I have. These work great for this."
positive,"You don't often come across, at least nowadays, an item that speaks of quality and craftsmanship care. Well, this is one of them items. Solid aluminum, thick, seems CNC machined, rubber ring caskets inside, the anti-theft side tiny allen wrench screws (which would have been .5mm shorter). just about the only thing I'd've included is some sort of locking agent, like red loctite - tiny amount - so that the little screws wouldn't pop off due to vibrations.<br /><br />Still, a job well done on these - man I can't believe how nice they are!"
positive,"Sturdy enough. Installed easily. One issue is that the glossy black paint was chipped off completely in a dime-sized area at one end. The paint ship wasn't in the box, so assume it was this was before shipping. Not the end of the world, but will need to watch that corner (and repaint every so often) to make sure it doesn't rust."
positive,Perfect fit and bargain rate for an easy fix.
positive,"Buy a couple extra in case they ever stop working. I was a little skeptical about buying this relay because it was so cheap, but so far its been great. The big plus is its a fraction of the cost of  the $70 oem yamaha relay."
positive,Fits perfect and looks very durable. Very well made. Used in a Dodge Dakota 2007.
positive,Works.
positive,"This is a great car wash. It smells great and washes well without scratching. After I dried my truck, I could already see the difference as it has a nice glossy finish that made my truck sparkle and shine!"
positive,Great bargain for the price. Very satisfied.
negative,It deflates to almost nothing. The height i needed disappeared within minutes. Ty
positive,I have purchased and acquired many products for and through Amazon. All of which have been as described and advertised. Each purchase if for pleasure or for projects have successfully met my quality expectations and goals. I plan to use this service again for each new item I may need first.
positive,Works great and easy to install
positive,Excellent easy fix for our Chevy Impala! Very pleased !
positive,"Fits perfect for upper hose in M119 engine. Solid hose, perfect fit. Better price than Autozone or Advance Auto, to say nothing for OEM. Solid deal!"
positive,"Love it, used it on my motorcycle tank bags and they look brand new!!!!<br /><br />SUPER, SUPER easy to use!"
positive,The original light bulbs were very yellow and not very bright. These LED lights are bright white and easy on the eyes and low wattage!
positive,"I installed this under the back tire rack on my e-bike. It is quite incognito. The remote for arming and disarming the alarm works great, even works through walls when I am inside the house. I like that it warns you when you start to move the bike. Continue to move the bike, it will go off and alarm. I am very pleased with this alarm to use along with my heavy duty bike lock."
positive,Best if used asap on newer glass. Once you have imperfections there isnt a way back.
positive,This product goes on easy. Just make sure wheel is clean and thectemmp is not to cold. Very pleased
positive,Rugged and fits tight/perfectly.
positive,"So nice, fits well, looks sharp!!!"
positive,Easy to install. Works perfectly.
positive,Fit my 2017 Forester perfectly. Easy to place.
negative,I have multiple electric throws and blankets but bought this one to use as a Christmas gift for someone with a convertible.  It plugs into the cigarette outlet and works but doesn’t get very warm.  It’s much cooler than my e blankets that use an AC power cord.  Maybe this is expected with a cigarette outlet plug?  I’m not sure….
positive,Nice replacement for my old tailgate handle as it had broken. Sturdy enough for constant use.
positive,Works just right and fits the can I use
positive,"Tools works perfectly, just removed all 16 valves for new stem seals. Metric bolts were class 12.9. The zinc plated nut seemed cheaper, but I had zero problems with it. Hopefully class 8.8.<br /><br />The machining of the aluminum spacer is bizarre to me; I’m not sure of the thought behind it. Anyway, spacer goes against the head, with the T-shaped steel bracket laying on top. Used a cordless ratchet to quickly work the valve compressing nut.<br /><br />Wouldn’t hesitate to buy again."
positive,"This an awesome product! It holds my LG Stylo 3 nice and tight without issue. I mostly ride hardpack and greenway trails and it never comes loose. When I ride dirt, I occasionally reach down to give the thumb screw a little tighten, but it it always stays put off road as well. Come with mounting hardware to mount to handlebar, or the stem. I chose the stem mount and it looks great. Low profile and very sleek. I highly recommend this product over all the others!"
positive,This fixed our truck and made everything like it was supposed to be. Been installed 2 months and still going strong.
negative,"During certain times of the year, I drive home with the sun directly in my eyes.  I bought this to deal with the issue.  The plastic distorts the view a bit and doesn't provide the clear sun-free view I had hoped for.  It's better than nothing but it's a disappointment."
positive,"In my book, ""rubber"" weather mats are a must. Although this is not in a work vehicle, We often are not on concrete and asphalt. This helps contain the damage from all that sand, dirt, fertilizer, or whatever we track into the vehicle. This review is specific for the rear cargo mat and we tend to carry potentially messy items at times. After I had installed the mat, the chocolate milk container we purchased on the next grocery store run chose to start leaking . It was contained by the mat and was an easy cleanup. Nothing worse that trying to get soured milk residue out of the vehicle as it leaks down into the spare tire well. For me, this one disaster avoidance payed for the mat in one."
positive,"went on over Leather Honey which brought back the color of my sunburned couch. I should have used it sooner, of course, but I'm expecting it to take care of it from now on."
positive,Good product we are using near the sink of our RV bathroom for more storage space. I use another on the sidewall near our RV bed to hold my cell phone.
positive,"I had to take my brand new Reese Pro series A-frame jack to the bench grinder to shave off a few hairs to get this universal wheel to line up with the holes for the pin, not a terribly big deal, but it did require an extra step."
positive,"PERFECT, my husband and whole family loved it and still does."
positive,it's a filter
positive,"Easy to install, really great for stored vehicle."
negative,i have yet to mount the product as it arrived without the stud and bolts to replace the factory installed item. you will need a tie rod puller to remove the damper from the drag link.<br />i called RANCHO and they are supposed to be back ordered on the part. i admit to my disappointment and look forward to installing it and feeling a difference.
positive,"I purchased this as a gift to my husband. He recently installed a bed cover on his truck because we needed a lot more covered/protected storage on various road trips. So this organizer comes in super handy for those things that might be in the way in the cab, but you don’t want them rolling around in the truck bed. You can collapse it down for storage or use 1, 2, or all 3 compartments depending on you needs and available space. The compartments are great for so many things, and of course, the cooler comes in handy at soccer tournaments or trips to the grocery store. We may need to get another one in the future because we do travel quite a bit. I would definitely recommend this."
positive,Fit our new Polaris Ranger 570 with no problems. Dressed up the steel wheels in short order. Plenty of clearance for inspection of the hub and tire stem.
positive,"Excellent aftermarket product! Super easy to install, chrome look and just looks great on my car"
positive,Worked good on my SXS.
positive,VERY GOOD
positive,"Aww yesss, everything you need in one unit.  flashlight, air compressor, jump starter.... All in one!  Really awesome to keep in the trunk!<br /><br />Like with all lithium ion batteries, do not store this fully charged.  It's best to put it in your car at 50-70% charge.  If you store it at 100%, it will self-discharge in about 2 months.  If you store it at 60% or so, it can last 6-12 months!<br /><br />This is how it is for all lithium ion batteries.<br /><br />Love it!"
positive,"I have no clue why there is only one review so far on this thing, and it's low?!!!<br /><br />So far, I have only received the hardware (XKchrome Moto Advance), and have plugged it in and tested it (as they recommend BEFORE you start getting serious on the install).<br />Originally the unit would not sync to bluetooth (but the lights lit up when plugged in...  true to all other XKGLOW reviews I read, they were SUPER good at taking my call (an actual person answered!!! - and he answered by name...  Randy I think), and within a minute, decided the controller was a problem, and had a new one in the mail to me (shipping and tracking confirmation) with a return envelope for the defect...  I had the replacement in two days.  It worked no problem.  I strung ALL lights and extensions together to ensure all connections and hardware worked..  all did perfectly.  Then I played with the software...  I was a 50 year old man like a kid at Christmas...  so freaked out at how awesome this thing was.  I'm now playing with HOW I will wire this up and configure it on my hog, because there are so many ways it could be done...  truly flexible, and have since ordered some extras (splitters AND the signal light kit).<br /><br />Based on my experience with their Customer Service and the ratings at Amazon, I have NO doubt these guys will ensure I'm happy with how I end up.  This is not a cheap investment for my bike at $214, and then another $80 for extras since...  but I feel like I'm being taken care of like a gut that spend solid cash, and they seem to act like they're confident in a solid product.  I can't provide product install reviews because I'm taking my time on that part, but other Amazon reviews had no indications of prevalent hardware issues on lights...<br /><br />My 5 stars are based on what the product is expected to do, and do well.  And it does.  The Customer Service is the 5 star clincher - VERY important to me.  Could some things be better...  sure.  But I'm not rating them on what I wish was better...  they were awesome at answering all my questions by email as well, and super fast, and did make note of my suggestions.  This is where they might get a bit better...  a PDF manual that I can print or read through on how to use all the software capabilities, and what it can / can't do.  Mostly it's intuitive...  a couple things weren't (the cycling of lighting from the divot).<br /><br />Oh...  one driver for me is SAFETY...  the Red lighting when brakes are on, and orange (on either side) when signal are on is a huge plug for my decision as well.  Once you have the base controller, you can add, configure and customize 1000 differeny ways, and add items economically as you go.<br /><br />I will provide more feedback once in place and perhaps include pics (I'm busy so I might not get back here for a couple months)...  but all in all, I did tons of research before I took the plunge.  This is &#34;THE&#34; solution to give you full color controls (say to  match another item that is already a set BLUE on my bike), and tons of control options...  can't wait.<br /><br />Tried to leave update...  lost all my words..  hope this works.<br />Short version...  this is a great set.  Software is capable, but would benefit from a guide.<br />Take lots of time to plan your wiring and lighting...  draw it out, and test different spots...  sometimes the most intuitive spot or part is not the best one.  See my pics and drawings.  The red version was when I hit the brakes."
positive,I am woman and I was able to install them myself. Just reffer to online manual (wish the seller include it with the box). Fits Subaru  Forester 2016. The only thing bothers me if I really needed them. I have feeling that they will be a problem once snow starts-they kind of hanging a bit low.
positive,Just what I wanted good product
positive,a
positive,"The original factory switch in my 1991 Pontiac Trans Am developed a sticky button and would not release completely, so the car computer was receiving a constant signal that the clutch pedal was depressed which meant that I was able to start the car anytime in any gear (neutral included) without having to actually push the clutch pedal all the way down...that was a dangerous situation. After installing this beautiful little part, I get zero response from the ignition system when trying to start the car without the clutch pedal fully depressed, and when the clutch pedal is fully depressed the car starts real nice. Perfect!"
positive,So far so good.
negative,doesn' do the job as well as hoped.
positive,I installed this on an easy go cart that had the Kawasaki 400cc single cyl. engine it fit and looked like the O.E. part it runs great again. Stay away from fuel with alcohol to prevent fuel related problems.
positive,Awesome for long drives.  Makes a big difference
positive,Looks good and fits my 2017 Mazda CX-5 well!!
positive,It works like it said. I found out you need to use a drill to polish with to make the item look good.
positive,"I use this to contain a few sheets of newspaper for my small dog to use while I'm at work. It's sturdy, and works great. Highly recommend for this purpose. Dog used it on first day, and easy to clean."
positive,"Installed two sets of these in the curtain track above my kitchen counter. Very bright, natural light, perfect for this application."
positive,"Well, it does what it’s supposed to do and replaces an easily lost OEM part. It’s a shame you’re paying so much money for a SINGLE clip that probably costs pennies."
positive,"Quick service, perfect quality and fit. Thanks!"
positive,"Like  most people I get annoyed when I drop items between the seat and console, and most of the time it is my phone or keys which I really need.  These gap fillers are made from semi-hard pleather, and look nie even though once in place you don't really see them.  Since I put these in my car I have not had to go fishing underneath my car seats, and that makes me happy.  Recommend"
positive,Love this! I don't scald my arm on my console anymore in the hot West Texas sun! I highly recommend it!
negative,"The description of this roof rack says its compatible with flush rails, I do not feel comfortable carrying anything heavyweight on this. It doesn't feel super secure. This is definitely More for non-flush railing. The build quality is okay, a mixture of plastic and cheaper quality metals. It's rated at a max load of 150 lbs in the instructions. I won't put anything that heavy. I think there is some room for improvement here, but this will do for now."
negative,I was in the middle of bleeding my brakes and I heard a pop and the pump started leaking. Never went above 10 PSI.  Was given a refund right away by Amazon so it didnt hurt too bad. Had to go to the hardware store and purchase a name brand for 3x the price. Lesson learned when it comes to this type of equipment.
positive,"4 hr drive,ended up using both my and built in straps just for my own peace of mind,total of 7 to 8 hr drive,I did run up on 90 mph,for the price recommended"
positive,Wow for plastic it looks great . I had to do a little work to make if my motorcycle . But wow it nice very happy
positive,"Looks good installed, installation was an easy, and fit was perfect. was trying to clean up my older F150 and make it look a little more modern without spending money on a new truck since its still low mileage. These were an easy to install upgrade, I did combine this with some new brighter LED backup lights instead of reusing the factory bulbs as some reviewers had mentioned not seeing clearly due to the smoke lenses. [[ASIN:B00NPIUFMM JDM ASTAR 1200 Lumens Extremely Bright 144-EX Chipsets 3056 3156 3057 3157 LED Bulbs with Projector , Xenon White]]. Visibility is great with these installed while backing up, though I didn't try with the stock to see how much of a difference they made."
positive,This cat brush was super easy to use and removes fur knots gently . My cats love this one a lot better because it is not to harsh on their fur.
positive,Just as I had hoped for.
negative,This is a basic throw-over seat cover to keep your favorite pet from destroying your vehicle's interior. My Bubba likes to stand with his back feet on the rear seat (covered) and his front feet on the center front armrest (also covered). Sometimes he will lay down and then get back up. This is when the static electricity gets me in the right arm while I'm driving.
positive,"Ok, I drive an old car with cloth seats that I bought used in 2009. The rear seats came with nasty stains from the Toyota dealer, which apparently wasn’t able to remove them. I tried to remove the stains years ago and failed.  I read about this cleaner on some click-bait list recently and decided to give it a try so my kids wouldn’t be so embarrassed about riding in my car.  Completely shocked!  The stains came out!  Had to use lots of the cleaner and a small brush to agitate and whip it up into a visible white lather first. I didn’t need to let it sit long.  I started wiping with paper towels and the stains kept coming off. I used half a roll of paper towels to lift up all the stains. Just lightly and accidentally touching the area with a paper towel would immediately soak up dirt. This truly is a miracle cleaner on old cloth seats. That said, it didn’t do anything special on vinyl areas of car - it cleaned them but didn’t seem to do anything more than other cleaners in those vinyl areas."
negative,Not as described extremely way to big !!! Way bigger than size! Don’t say anything about restocking fee but they got us for it and it took them a month before we received or refund but they had there product way before that
positive,Love the horn! It gave me 2014 jk a little punch!
positive,thanks
positive,Easy to apply.  Not sure if it works though
positive,"Radio looks great and like it came with the truck.  Haven't been able to try making a call with the blue tooth, but the bluetooth audio and usb aux connections work great.  Very easy to install. I got mine from warehouse deals for a great deal due to a blemish on the front.  You can see it in the picture, but not a big deal at all in a 17 year old truck."
positive,"These wheel skins are VERY easy to install and look great! All you do is wipe down the rim, remove the center cap, line up the new wheel skin and push it on. You will hear it clicking in place, then there is a plastic wing nut that you tighten down and then put the center cap back on. They are held in place tightly and after my initial fear that they would pop off like a hub cap after hitting bumps, I am no longer concerned about that, they are held on tightly. They look great too. For $100 they are well worth it and transform the look of my Ram. Installation took me less than 5min per wheel."
positive,using this make cleaning a car much easier.  no more bending and you can reach spots that you normally cant.
positive,Item as described.
positive,Cheap and stops a trailer. Job complete.
positive,did not dislike anything ... used on a 2019 subaru
positive,"Was supposed to be 10 Aluminum Drain Plug washers, but came as a BOLT brand kit with 5 aluminum and 5 copper washers.  I'm OK with it as I can use both.  Hopefully this was a mistake, but be aware.  Bolt: DPWM12.20-10."
positive,Exactly what we needed!
positive,Looks good
negative,These were pretty enough but they were way too thick. Almost blocked all the air. Could be made a little more thinner they would be really nice
positive,"I do the research before I buy stuff.  I chose the Truxport model because of the reviews for its ability to keep out the weather, and the price.  Installed correctly, this tonneau cover will not let in any rain, even in a strong storm.  Fingers crossed! The Velcro keeps it good and tight. It rolls up nicely.  The latches are sound quality.<br /><br />It’s only been installed for a week, so I can’t comment on long term durability or reliability.<br />Based on initial impression of this product I would buy it again."
positive,The hardest part with using this devices is finding the app that best suits your needs.
positive,ok
positive,I'm always skeptical that charcoal filters don't have any charcoal well you can see the little spheres free floating in this filter I like it a lot and will buy this for every vehicle I have that is available
negative,Straight up garbage.  The carbon is faded. Half shiny. Half dull.  Doesn’t hold. Doesn’t fit 100%<br /><br />Waste of money. Threw it in trash.
negative,It did trim a very thin piece of the wiper off but the wipers did not act as new by any stretch of the imagination… Lots of streaks lots of imperfections. Could be the way I used it but really feel it’s not as advertised
positive,"Works great, easy to use. Highly recommend."
positive,I use these spacers on my 2016 Polaris RZR XP4 1000. I live in Arizona and we can ride it fully street legal. The extra width gives a much more stable feel going around corners both on the pavement and in the dirt. They are easy to remove and put back on as well. We haul our razor in a toy hauler and I have to remove the spacers in order for it to fit in the toy hauler garage. Only takes a few minutes with the proper tools.<br />Update 03/15/2023:<br />I damaged one of the studs somehow and broke it off inside the lug nut. I emailed Orion for assistance to remove the broken stud. They responded within minutes and was able to give me instructions as to the best method to extract the broken stud. Not only are the wheel spacers a great product but they are backed by a company who cares about their customers and backs their products. Thank you Orion. I will tell everyone about your product.
positive,A must have for any RVer’s. Really cuts down on the heat coming in from the vents or keeps the heat in. A+
positive,Decent product at reasonable price
positive,"Like the mat. I usually have a folder of all my auto receipts in a folder in on the back seat but this one has a pocket for that so I put that in the back of it.<br />I have it in a Honda Accord EX and its somewhat too large. I'd buy it again but probably for an SUV.<br />The fit is off, that's why 4 stars."
positive,This is GREAT!! I live in an apartment complex without access to a hose - this has made it possible to wash my car weekly with just a few gallons of water in a bucket.  Cleans well and is safe for the environment.
positive,Exelente
positive,Wow!! Great Product for an even better price!! Cant find this easy to install quality product anywhere for this price... Will Highly Recommend this part to anyone looking for an awesome Bug-Deflector.. A+A+A+A+A+ 5-STARS *****
negative,Arrived with scratches on both light check yours before install it
negative,"Its OK, I agree with other reviewers, its kind of high price for a piece of plastic, from the description I thought it would be a little heavier duty or possibly even metal. It does look nice though."
negative,I have a 2010 A4 2.0T and it does not show my oil level at all.
positive,Highly recommend.<br />Very durable and well made.
positive,Fit my sons key perfect and allows him to use a key ring again.
positive,"Much brighter than I expected for the price.  I've had it a few months, still going strong.  Fits my Jeep Wrangler, just leave the shield off."
positive,Love the bling for my car!  Fits and looks just as expected.
positive,"Cute.  Easy to apply.  Though I though, by the picture, it would have been a bit bigger. Still, really cute!"
positive,These rear wheel hubs are great they are made well and easy to install.I would recommend this product.
positive,Fit my 78 XL 350 perfectly.  A must have if you want your lights to work at night.
positive,Great can say anything less
positive,fits and looks great on my ZX12R.
positive,I will keep buying this item . Best for Diesel equipment
positive,I am a smoker and I use these about every other month or so and it gets rid of the smoke smell every time. Leaves the car smelling nice and fresh.
positive,thank you
positive,Product was as described
positive,Strong and well built. Nothing cheap on this. Love it.
positive,After having this on my last two trucks it was a must on this one. My last two trucks we’re both rams and it was definitely more difficult to install on those that it was on this old GMC. Took about 10 minutes from start to finish. Well satisfied and In the future any new truck that I buy that doesn’t have this as an option will be getting one of these added to it.
positive,Slide on guide fits great.  Bubble is a little than original but it will work fine.
positive,"Fits perfectly on a 1995 S10 4.3L, W engine.  Looks similar to the original part and fits great.  Has two new screws too."
positive,great product. good price and service
positive,Purchased these to replace the bulbs in my RV vanity. The light is bright and true and completely changed the way the entire area looks. I love them!
positive,Everything arrived on time with no issues.  They are Toyota Highlander mats so i expected them to fit and they did.  They really help during the winter snow and mud.
positive,Nice wiper
positive,Good product and good price
positive,"Out of the gate the AutoChoice Premium Car Seat Organizer with Leather Cover is a good, solid cup holder.<br /><br />We have one that holds a single cup/can/glass, along with a long section for other items. It works great, but with a phone holder in our regular cup holders, this only added the second one. We still have times we need a third. So I thought this might work as a backup/partner to the other one (both are for passenger side only - we do not feel it’s safe on the drivers side).<br /><br />I am right. This adds the second and third holders and works very well. Yes, there is a but...<br /><br />1. It looks nice - in fact it matches our other ones (one for each car) perfectly. The faux black leather with red stitching looks nice (our opinion) and we like how it goes in both cars - this double holder matching it all perfectly.<br />2. This one has the same set up: a long section that slides between the seat and the center consul. It works well. And in this case there is a single padding that fits in there - protecting the seat as well as maintaining the hold. The other one we have as pieces that are not secure. We love that this one has a single piece and that it stay put. This means there is a quality here we really appreciate.<br />3. That said - this one is thick all the way around. it really stays securely in there.<br />4. That said - the thickness also means that the whole thing is thicker and does take up more room on the passengers side. My wife finds it okay for shorter trips or when it’s really needed, but she’d rather it only be used when we need it. It does take enough space that it feels like an intrusion. She tries to keep it as far forward as possible. But because of the second cup holder - rather than the thinner space needed in the other one we have for misc items like a phone or credit cards - this one is thick in order to allow for the cups. This means it takes up that much more room. If she’s not with me and I’m grabbing that coffee or something I can have it and not worry - extra cup space has been missed without it. But with a person there, we both feel like it’s not going to make the ride comfortable for the passenger.<br /><br />We are keeping it in our backseat and it does get switched out when needed. And because of how it’s designed we can do that - easily slip it in or out - and we have no issue with having two of these for different purposes. This is a great holder and the extra cup space works great. But again, using it while having a person there is likely something to consider - it will take up a lot of their personal space. We highly recommend our two option set up - it works great! This AutoChoice Premium Car Seat Organizer with Leather Cover is great and we are happy to have it."
positive,Nice grips.  They do grip well and are comfortable.
positive,I really like these gloves.  I wore them on a 40 degree morning here in Colorado and my hands did not get cold.<br />They are pretty thick (which is the only drawback) so you have to make sure you can operate everything good before you<br />take off.<br />  I know they are good to 40 degree weather riding on the interstate at 75 mph.
positive,"This TriNova trim restorer is the 2nd best product I have ever used with the best being a far more expensive per use ceramic product.<br />TriNova is especially friendly on a vehicle interior trim with likely a years worth of use. It has been on my Spyder motorcycle for a few months & unlike all the rest retains the majority of its initial luster.<br />Soooooo unless you pay far more for a professional ceramic product, this is user friendly & outperforms the rest."
positive,"Good product but needed to spend time with a grinder to enable this to fit into my receiver.  Once on and in, great look and feel - just would have liked not having to futzz with it to make it fit."
positive,"Once you get them to stay in the holders in the panel, they are fine.<br /><br />They probably are ever so much thinner than the OEM.  Depending on the panel, a slight dab of e6000 or hot melt glue gun holds them until they seat"
positive,"I like these sun shades. Sun shades are nothing to get excited about, but these do the trick just fine. I did not want to purchase the ""roller"" type sun shades as I would be paranoid in a car accident these would become a safety hazard. These sun shades do not have any hard plastic or metal on them at all. I am not worried about them causing much injury if for some reason they would get dislodged in a car accident. I drive a 2014 VW Passat and these shades JUST barely fit on my back windows. I have to sneak the bottom corner down into the window seal in order to get them to fit. They still do not seal 100% but they have been attached to my window for about a month, and seem to be hanging in just fine."
positive,As expected.
positive,"I have high arched windows above the regular windows throughout my house and the only way for me to clean them without this device would be to get up and down the 6' ladder using a wet cloth. This telegraphing pole allowed me to stay safely on the ground and clean them using the microfiber cleaning head on the one side, then wipe the dirt and water away cleanly using the squeegee on the other side.<br /><br />I'd recently had the house painted and they pressure washed it and left all of the windows a mess afterwards, so I was really able to give this a good test by cleaning those high windows. Cleaning with the microfiber head was similar to doing it by hand with a microfiber cloth - meaning I had to go over especially stuck on things like bird droppings with some extra oomph - but instead of needing to climb up and down a ladder to wash, rinse, and wash again I could do it on the ground where I didn't risk a fall and I could rinse and wash more quickly. I do wish that the microfiber head was just a little bit larger than it is though, but that's my only complaint.<br /><br />The squeegee head worked as well as a hand held squeegee does (in my opinion at least). I found that it took more than one wipe at times, and it seemed to work better when I used enough pressure to press it more firmly against the glass as I brought it downwards - just like a hand held squeegee.<br /><br /> I hope the pictures I took show up well enough so you can see how dirty my windows were, and how clean I was able to get them using this high window cleaner. Overall I really like this window cleaning tool a lot because it did a good job, speeded up the process so I got done faster than I could have otherwise, and I didn't need to climb up and down a ladder to get the work done. In fact, I didn't even have to get the ladder out of the garage.<br /><br />I purchased this high window cleaning tool at a reduced price for testing, evaluation, and review purposes."
negative,Truly a good tire shine for the money but it slings everywhere really messing up a crystal black paint job
positive,"Sun shade easy to install ,, sturdy, fits good on Tundra truck ,, would buy again."
positive,"Works great,  It replaced a 20 year old model that was held together by zip ties and a prayer.  Don't bother with shorter versions as you can always shorten a long one, but you can't lengthen a short oneI"
negative,One light broke as I was installing it. Seems weak at the juncture of the LEDs and the base. Not as bright as OEM bulbs.
positive,built well
positive,Easy to install and bright
positive,easy install. looks so clean compared to the original ones that took a beating.
positive,"I was having a problem with my brake light going out, very often, only on the one side.  I tried bulbs, I tried a new socket, and finally, I bought this new assembly.  FIXED IT!  Fit was perfect, looks exactly like the OEM assembly.  I'm most pleased."
positive,"2nd day update:<br />See last 2 pictures. It rained and blew a ton of dust the night after the full detail. (Of course) the first is the dirty, the last picture is after a quick rinse and dry. Although it didn't completely repell the rain it came off super ez. And shined up like it never happened with minimal effort. Crazy how good this works.<br />Used this for the first time today. Used as a wax to clean after doing an at home pressure wash with my foam cannon. Unfortunately I have very hard water at my house so it's nearly impossible to get it perfectly dry. There is almost always hard water spots.<br />I decided to try this as a finishing product and I could not believe how great it works. It's literally a mirror finish all the way around. Every surface plastic, chrome, rims and paint all shine very easily.<br />I used about a quarter of  a bottle to detail a 2021 silverado z71 from front to back including the inside of the door trim and every surface including the external glass. Pretty impressive.<br />TIPS:<br />I used a micro fiber detailing sponge as the wet rub and it worked well.<br />Make sure whatever you use for the wet wipes portion stays damp. If it gets too dry it is A LOT more work. Comes off really easier if you keep the cloth/sponge damp. Not dripping wet, just hand squeeze dry it and that's about perfect.<br />You will notice a build up in the dry cloth, I used 2 micro fiber clothes on the body and trim and a third for the rims. Even though I used the same wet sponge for the whole truck.<br />The dry cloth needs to be clean to get the best shine.<br />Last tip, if you aren't sure whether or not you have done a surface gently wipe a micro fiber on it. If it's been armored it will slide without resistance. If not, it will feel much different.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product!"
positive,"This gadget is made to do siding, RV's, or anything else that needs washing.  Mine came with no working shut off valve.  It is cheap plastic and it came busted from the factory.  So i purchased an inline brass valve and wha lah, I was back in business.  I bought the brush to do our back siding because I don't do ladders anymore.  One annoyance other than a broken valve is that the brush does not lock in place, so it can and will turn slightly on use and have to be re-tightened.  That design is flawed.  But it is not a deal breaker. I saved a couple hundred bucks doing this job myself."
positive,Very well made for the money.
negative,"visual check your brakes or order using vin number. There are 2 designs that come up under the same listing for this brake set no matter where you go. 1 has a tab for a spring on the bottom the other does not. Of course, I did not get lucky. Not the vendors fault. I checked 5 different sources and they all have the same problem."
positive,"Nice sticker, put on my truck and it's holding up great. Good quality product."
positive,Quick and the pressure settings work perfectly. It sets the PSI in the scooter's tires dead on. Great time saving gizmo.
positive,Gorgeous and the most comfy helmet you’ll ever own. I considered the Simpson one that is $500 and I’m so glad I stuck with biltwell - we got two for what one of theirs cost!
positive,Good
positive,nicely done
negative,This drying towel is not absorbent at all.  Was extremely disappointed.  Chemical guys has really fallen off the last few years.  Very disappointing
positive,Works great
positive,"Excellent! Received the keys/FOBs, called a local locksmith, he came same day and programmed and cut both for $100. Saved me ~$100-200."
positive,It wraps nicely but would have liked it to wrap alittle closer together leaves a gap of 1in. It may improve with time. There is no foam insert which is great
positive,"Love this. Keeps my car cooler, although I can say it does leave a slight gap on either side so it's not blocking all of the sun. Works fine, though and makes me smile every time I walk out to my car."
positive,Add heavy duty 3m on corners.  None have strong enough tape
positive,I've been without a remote for my car for years. I thought it would be hundreds of dollars at a dealer to get a new one. I can't believe how easy this was to set up and I LOVE IT!!!!
positive,Absolutely love these lights!! My husband wired them into the only light we had on our camper outside so it’s turn on with a light switch! It looks like the lights came with the camper!! The lights give off a lot of light too. Very happy with price and this product as well. Great product!
negative,"I returned it because it had only connectors at the top. Bottom corners have nothing. So even though it would be fine just to put stuff inside of, anything else in the trunk will come barreling through it and land against the trunk door with the stuff inside the net since it is not secured at the bottom. Wanted a cargo net that would prevent cargo from sliding out of the car when  I open the door. Stuff will slide right under this if it’s not items that go inside the net itself."
negative,"Mine arrived with no smell whatsoever, and looked old."
negative,"Unlike most reviewers, I not only found no difference, but it seemed to make the off-idle hesitation worse. Wow, what a waste of $'s this was. They seem to work for other people, but not for me. 4.3l S10 Chevy with an off-idle stumble."
positive,"I needed these u-bolts fast , got them faster than expected, and they were a quality product. I wouldn't hesitate to order these again!"
negative,Schumacher SE-1052 battery charger jump starter arrived after a long wait.  The outer shipping box was ripped open so the contents were visible. The manufacturers original box inside was beaten up but still intact. Opening the box was a bit of a disappointment. The charger appeared to be a black powder coat finish however the steel housing was poorly lined up with gaps at the edges. There were scuffs in the finish on the top.There were screws with security hex heads that were hastily assembled because they were stripped. All in all I set this thing on the shelf in the garage and will use it with trepidation wondering whether it will self destruct considering the poor fit and finish. I will update.
positive,"This was a gift, but I have one like it and love it.  It extends longer than others and it very sturdy."
positive,Huge pain in the ass to adjust!
positive,I needed to trace the problem with my leaf blower and after going thru the machine I decided a carb is the answer. This kit is actually amazing and has all you will need to do this simple job. I can't wait to install and get the blower up and running again. I miss using my blower since it can clear a yard with leaves in no time with a 250mph strength blower. I will update this review upon installation.
positive,"Perfect fit for a 2000 Accord SE. Easy because the ball joint is ready, no pressing required."
positive,Works good!! Let dry before you put your butt down on couch! 😃
positive,Sturdy. Like the flat pad. I use 4 of these to get all 4 wheels off the ground. Great support.
negative,"I wound up not using this product, the size and shape didn't work for the space in my vehicle. I should have returned it. I don't have an opinion on how well they would have functioned."
positive,Worked great. Very happy!
negative,"didn't include the blinker bulbs, wth!  luckily, has spares but would have assumed it would come with all necessary bulbs in place."
positive,Good
positive,These were a good replacement for our vents on a Sunseeker. The material was thinner than what we were replacing but seeing as how the sun broke those down over a few years I don't want to spend too much for it to just happen again. It has been a year already and they are still going strong.
negative,"This could be a very good review - except - there was a leak in the flex hose slightly larger than a pinhole - VERY disgusting.  Have not been successful yet in plugging the hole.<br /><br />The handle is about 6"" too short, for an average arm length person (I am 6' ) to pull naturally without it banging into your feet, or stumbling as you pull 300+ lbs of liquid gold.  Why the engineers would design like this is beyond logic - unless of course they were pressured by the cost accountants to save a few bucks in material because it uses 6"" less rectangular steel.  If you buy it, figure out a way to extend the handle and share that on line please!  Come on Barker, make your products right with zero defects, and test in the market for usability / practicality!!!"
positive,My Mazda CX-5 had a perfect gap to “eat” my cell phone or anything else. This is the perfect problem solver!
negative,"This part DOES NOT FIT a 2001 Ford Focus with 2.0 engine. The pump itself the connect is different, a wire harness has to be installed to splice it in and make it work. The pump itself is too tall to fit in the canister with the filter attached. The filter does not fit inside of the canister length and width wise either. The rubber boot has to be trimmed for the filter to be installed on. The outside filter DOES NOT FIT THE FUEL PUMP UNIT. The inlet on the pump canister is larger than the inlet on the filter. I tried both, they do not fit. Totally useless and a waste of my time and money."
positive,hard to know what it was from pictures not what I needed but will keep it in case
negative,"Item description says for bumper sticker, but this is extremely small and would fit better on a phone case or water bottle. It wouldn’t show up anywhere on your car."
positive,"I've collected a bunch of useless gadgets in my time, but this little gadget has been used almost daily for the past 3 years and no signs of slowing down.  It's the best thing for removing spots, eggshells and chalazeas."
positive,"Love this Jacket, got it for my husband, spring biker jacket Looks fantastic on. I would recommend this jacket !"
positive,Fairly easy to install.  They look great!  Don’t know how long they will stay clear.  One side already had scratches but that is nothing compared to the cloudiness that the old pair had.  Excited to see the difference they make at night as the old pair made driving at night difficult.
positive,A good substitute for the type of loom that permanently attaches to the lugs of a single battery. Use these if you are moving the charger between different batteries.
positive,all good
positive,"Great cover at a reasonable price. After throwing away my 2nd &#34;generic&#34; car cover, finally decided to invest in a custom-fit cover for my Nissan 350Z. This beauty fits like a glove, well made, excellent seams and coverage. I highly recommend this cover!"
positive,"Adhesion and sound deadening are good for 50 mil. The sheets are large, which makes it harder to manage, especially if there are alot of curvature areas in vehicle."
positive,Tires seem to be in good shape. Nice tread for the price. Don't know how well they will hold up. On car so let's see
positive,"Didn't know I had to ground every light, the old one had only one ground point.  Don't install these every day and it was pretty straight forward"
positive,Speed sensor was identified with a check engine system and it did fix the tranny issue.
negative,Junk made my compressor come on everytime I started my truck then it blew on my feet and vent then it when dead after one month save your money and buy used at a junk yard thats what I did mines working great with quality original part dont buy this Dorman junk
positive,This is completely trustable.  I've been at 168 mph for 2 minutes and the beads are far better than lead weights mounted on your wheels.  I use this in all my Ducati motorcycles.
positive,"Great for 2014 sienna, super quiet and hardly any break dust. If you purchase pads from a auto parts store and care what your rims look like you will be cleaning the rims a lot."
positive,It fit perfectly in my 23 Maverick pickup and is very nice at keeping things organized.
positive,This is a good cover and it does it's job in being mostly water proof and breathable. After a few months of use it developed a couple of minor tears but they didn't really effect things too much as they were near the edges.
negative,It worked for one week and then stopped. Not a good quality product. Useless
negative,"These fold up nicely and are very easy to use, but they just didn't work for me. They covered about 90% of my windshield (2014 Chevy Spark) and the car was still the same temperature as usual at the end of the day (116 F according to the internal thermometer)."
negative,"The product itself is excellent, but the spray bottle leaks a drop or two through the underside of the trigger every time I spray it, which always seems to land somewhere I don't want it to. The trigger doesn't appear to be damaged, so because of this inherent flaw in the operation, I can't give this more than 3 stars."
positive,"The most important single thing I look for in 12v motorized auto accessories is adequate cord length to reach the cigarette lighter. This set meets my main objective. Optional jumper battery clamps are included.<br /><br />Most of my jack work is in the driveway. This works great. I have an intrinsic horror at needing to speed switch out a blowout on the 405 just after the Getty Center exit at midnight. If you know what I mean, it should be enough motivation to exit the manual jack plan.<br /><br />The kit case is compact and sits under the back seat of my F-150. The scissor jack design itself is virtually identical to the manual OEM jack.<br /><br />All good."
negative,It’s been probably two months or so since I got this out on. The led lights are t the greatest and as you can see in the picture they’re starting to not work at all. I want to like this product but sadly it’s a busy.
positive,"easy install, works fine so far"
positive,The best there is. And got it super fast.
positive,"Everything worked good and the battery charger shows the details in the LCD screen on progress. The 12 volt car battery we tested it on is a car that sits a lot during cold months and occasionally needs charging.<br /><br />What I did not like is when charging a 12 volt car battery it starts out at 8 amp then slowly decreases down to 1.1 amp.  My battery was about 80% charged before attaching this charger and this charger ran for at least 8 hours to finish. I think this is because these newer models with a microprocessor do this.  The point I wanted to make is the battery takes a lot longer to charge than older conventional non-digital ones. Also, the charger only displays in Celsius and in my opinion should have also had Farenheit.<br /><br />Still, this is a good charger and does what it says. It seems to have a strong case and runs only warm charging a 12 volt car battery that was 80% charged. I wasn't able to test it in repair mode because my battery is newer, doesn't show any signs of sulfating, and otherwise okay.  Overall it is good value compared to many costing more."
positive,"We have used these on our farm equipment and there are some lights burnt out already, but nothing impactful.  Great price and great overall product!"
negative,Too long and it will not fit.  Going back.
positive,"I have had absolutely no issues with this! It fits perfectly on both my 2015 Honda Grom and my 2012 Honda NC700x. Very sturdy, even at high speeds! I would definitely purchase again!"
negative,I did not appreciate one of the Dorman boxes being crushed and open - all parts are not there - demand replacement
positive,We have these on several trailers and I have installed them on many friends trailers and they are the BEST.<br />No more twisting and getting stuck etc. This hose has a cam lock (professional grade) and it works great.<br />  JUST BUY IT YOU WILL BE HAPPY
positive,Very easy to use. Great quality.
positive,My daughter is a big fan of the Night before Christmas (sally) so I got this for her so she could put it on her truck
positive,Not the easiest application in a Nissan. Gotta get down and under a bit but the filter works great.
positive,This cost a fraction of what it would have from an auto parts store or dealership. The dealership quoted me $380 to order and install. I literally took me about two minutes to change it out myself.
positive,This is my second set for my wifes car.  THe first set lasted for 8 years.  They would still be good If I hadn't hit them with rocks from the snowblower.  Too bad you can't purchase these individually as I only broke the drivers side set.  Probably saved me from having to replace the windows now that I think about it.
negative,Looks good and fits good  except  one  hole to attach the sheild on was not accurate that's why it's getting a 2 star .
positive,Great cover scratches . Chevy brown color.
positive,The only grievance I have about this switch is that there's two small lights that the factory switch has that this one does not have other than that looks good works good can't complain
positive,"No, these don't clean you car as well as a big sponge and several buckets of soapy water. However, our daughter lives in an apartment complex that does not allow residents to wash their cars on the property (because of the cost of the water as well as drought restrictions). The nearest car wash charges $15. Her car is not the newest, so these wipes do a more than adequate job for a fraction of the price of the car wash. Even if you can wash your car at home, these wipes are much easier and faster since you don't have to dry the car afterwards and you don't have to wash all the dirty towels afterwards either.<br /><br />The wipes are also great for cleaning up bird poop, bug splat, etc.<br /><br />&#34;Not recommended for extremely dirty vehicles. On windows and dark-colored vehicles, a final buff with a dry clean microfiber towel will help you achieve an optimum shine.&#34;"
positive,Nice
positive,"This is the purple coolant, do pay attention to the type you purchase and what your vehicle requires.  I appreciate that it was premixed, the convenience of that was worth it for me."
positive,As advertised. Fit my car perfectly and is very soft. Steering wheel cover great so hands don’t get cold in the mornings after the car has been sitting. Gets compliments a lot too.
positive,Work perfect for the trailer rims give it better access for tire changes
positive,"I have run this brand and size of tires for over 20 years first on my CJ7 and now on my 4WD chevy s10.<br /><br />The Jeep was used in New England and gave excellent handling and traction in the harshest of winter snow conditions and went to places and roads most others could not travel on even in 4WD.<br /><br />I love them on my S10 4WD with a Rough Country  2&#34; suspension raise and in my new living area of SW Florida.<br /><br />No appreciable road noise and I find Handling to be excellent, the larger tires give my lift greater stability and wear after 25,000 miles is minimal.<br /><br />I would totally recommend these tires for use especially in harsh winter conditions."
negative,Did not fit. Had to alter it to be able to use it.
positive,Use it in my camper all the time. Allows me more counter space for my coffee maker.
positive,love love love 💕 love 💗 love ❤️ it!!
positive,"This product has a clean fresh smell, but not overpowering. It has a light blue color and the instructions say to use one ounce per 5 gallons of water. I probably used about double that amount because it didn’t seem to be knocking out the odor. It never quite eliminated the order, but did help. This product is for portable toilets in boats, RV’s, or any other type of portable potty. If you have one you need this product…buy it today!"
positive,Fit perfect and came with all the bulbs and fittings. That chrome assembly that they put on in the factory is UGGGGLY! Now my truck looks like it was supposed to look (at least to my eyes!)  I also got the matching OEM black headlights to match these.<br /><br />Easy install (5-10 min per side)... just be careful pulling off your old light assembly as to not scratch your paint or break any of the clips. It's a pretty snug fit from the factory!
positive,just what I wanted at a fraction of the price of the auto parts stores.  thanks.
positive,It made it so easy to blow out my water lines in our RV I should have purchased one of these years ago
positive,"This tank works either by gravity. . .  .If it’s above the tank you’re filling. .  .or. . . you have to continually pump the handle. .  .if you are even to the tank you’re filling.<br /><br />It’s large. . . And after it’s filled with fuel. . . it’s very heavy as well.  So if you’re taking this to a gas station to fill. . . You’ll want to keep that in mind.  You’ll also need your own straps to keep it stable.<br /><br />There are plastic wheels.  They work if “general” / occasional use, but would not be best for constant use.<br /><br />This items is Made in China and being sold by a U.S company.  At the current price of 160 bucks, it’s crazy.  If you look around you’ll see the same item being sold by Chinese companies for less.  I certainly prefer to purchase from a U.S. company. .  .But. . . When there’s a price differential for the same item. .  .you have to take that into consideration."
positive,"Looks cool, sticks well, item as described. Really adds that special stylish touch to our big old camper van. Love it!"
positive,"I;ve seen these for years, but never owned one.  It is the best snow clearer ever.  Worked like a charm."
positive,My son loves them. Perfect fit!!
negative,Those floor mats don’t last long. Won’t buy again
negative,This jack has plastic wheels....Its a piece of crap! Also has cheap Oring design hydraulic cylinder instead of the better u-cup design seals. The argonomic handle design is the only nice thing about it.
positive,I have some small 12V rechargeable batteries at home.  This is a perfect compliment to that.
positive,Worked perfectly and fit perfectly 2009 gmc sierra
positive,good product.  Good quality.
negative,For nearly $100 I expected more... it’s definitely an improvement over the cheapo Walmart cover but it’s nothing special. I can’t believe this is their “top of the line” cover. Bought the “sport bike” size to cover my KTM Duke 390 and it barely fits. I’d return it if I wasn’t such a lazy idiot.
positive,This is a very good quality replacement Harley twincam oil filter. No problems and fit s like original equipment.<br /><br />DS
positive,"This is a major step up visually from the old plastic screw handle one. Installation was easy, took me all of 10 minutes.  Unfortunately in no time the hot water tap started dripping no matter what I did. Very annoying and tap sets should last for longer than 12 uses.  So I installed a second one.  That started doing the same thing within 3 months. It seems impossible to find replacement cartridges, so if you replace the tap set, hang onto the ones from your old set.  Turns out it was not the cartridge that was leaking, it was the rubber seat that had a fault in it.  After much searching I was able to find a replacement part that fits perfectly  Delta Faucet RP4993, so thank goodness I did not have to go to the expense and hassle of changing it out yet again."
positive,I put these lovelies on my fridge.They are big bold and beautiful
negative,This is supposed to have a plastic internal extender cap to reach out and touch a sequoia door. This one does not. Plus for thelife of me im almost sure they increased tje price on this item after i bought it. I will be sending this POS back it wont work on a 2002 seqouia unless yiur fat girlfriend leans against the closed door. Forthe love of god!
positive,Make sure you buy 1 size up than you normally wear these run small! They fit great and are holding up very well
positive,"Bought this for Honda 1000-5 after reading several reviews. Product shipped quickly and packaged well. Installation is not difficult, it comes with good directions, but it does take a while. Mounted mine on top of my winch relay with the Velcro that comes with it, holds well.  Took me a couple of days for mounting my battery, stinger relay, fuse box, bus bars, and Tru Dual. It went smoothly. I thought I had a bad relay, called the company and call was answered by a real person. Extremely polite and walked me through the problem., which was my fault due to a poor ground. After about 5 minutes they had me fixed up and going. I will be doing business with them again. Thanks guys."
positive,"Bought this for my Son for his Birthday and he loves it, and says it looks great on his motorcycle."
positive,"Recently purchased this organizer and I am so happy with it.  It is so easy to set up, is it solid.  I like the ability to attach the unit to cargo stays in my SUV with some cables that I have.  Some have complained about the amount of off gasses that people detect.  I noticed a minor petroleum-based smell but this dissipated within a day or two.  Overall a really great buy."
positive,"Used this. Yesterday, it worked really well. It comes apart into three so it's easy to store  It comes apart into 3 pieces so it's easy to store. It did not scratch my van."
positive,"Easy to install, and woks great.  Price is right."
positive,These made my new truck look fantastic! the chrome handles look great now!
positive,I spend a few minutes every couple days with this product cleaning the leather chair and couch I have and the rag is dark gray and the cream colored leather appears lighter.  I am satisfied with this cleaner's effectivness.
positive,Great product. Even has its own storage bag
negative,"The console on the Tesla 3 (like any console) takes a beating over time) with wear since it's very often used (storage) and I put my elbow on there often (as does the passenger) so I wanted to protect the console cover. It took several minutes fighting and pulling to get the cover on (watch the video as it helps, but it still was difficult to install). I FINALLY was able to get it onto the console so now it looks ALMOST like the original cover but it's not a perfect either. It's almost too small so when you are putting on this cover you have to make sure the back of the console is where you start when putting on the cover and then pull (and pull and pull and stretch the cover as best you can) to pull it over the front part of the console cover. I almost gave up and finally got it fitted...but it is not perfectly fitted thus it looks good....not great.<br /><br />I will give it 3 stars. Good idea as the material matches perfectly but it's almost too small a cover and was a real struggle to get it onto the console. I am not sure if I ordered another one would it be a little larger thus fit better?"
positive,"Great product. Solid build, very long and easy to handle. And, yes, we did purchase these to make Harry Potter wands. The wand making abilities of these are as great as the food handling abilities. Good weight, shape and length for the perfect wizard wand."
positive,So cute and fit perfectly!
positive,Works great for protecting your car seats
positive,"good quality, fit perfectly on my Daughter's factory original '95 Honda Civic lx exhaust system.  I ordered this gasket at the same time I ordered a replacement muffler/tailpipe.  I'm glad I ordered this because the original gasket was destroyed while removing the old muffler."
positive,"Got a Mercedes C300 and it is very bright. Install was simple and easy, just had to buy the retaining clips separately. Shipping was fast."
negative,None of this cheap headlight kit fit properly. Turn signals were not made correctly either. Sent back for a refund
positive,"Nice but useless for tinted windows, great to keep bugs out if you camp in your car! It’s basically a screen but they are handy, I’ve used them in the past for kids in the back seat."
